# The PR Pro's Guide to AI
## 5 Frameworks That Actually Work (From Someone Who's Trained 200+ Comms Professionals)

**By Kris Krug, Founder of The Upgrade AI**

## A Note Before We Begin

Look, I get it.

You've watched the AI hype cycle spin for two years now. You've seen the breathless LinkedIn posts about "10x productivity" and "replacing entire teams." You've probably tried ChatGPT a few times, gotten mediocre results, and wondered what all the fuss is about.

Here's the thing: **Most people are using AI wrong for PR work.**

They're treating it like a magic box. Throw in a request, hope for the best. That's why they get generic outputs that sound like every other AI-generated press release flooding journalists' inboxes.

The PR professionals I've trained—at agencies, in corporate comms, at media companies—they've discovered something different. They've learned to use AI as a **thinking partner**, not a replacement. And the results speak for themselves:

- "Best coverage recap they'd ever received" — Client feedback to Lizzie
- 85% time savings on strategic planning — Allison's PR plan results
- Interactive dashboards replacing PDF reports — Simone's media monitoring transformation

This playbook gives you the five frameworks that make the difference. Not tool tutorials (those get outdated in weeks). Not prompts to copy-paste (those never work as well as the original context).

**Frameworks that transfer to any platform, any tool, any AI model.**

Let's go.

## Framework 1: The Grounded vs. Ungrounded Principle

### The Problem Most PR Pros Face

You need to write a briefing document about a client. You ask ChatGPT. It gives you confident-sounding information that's... wrong. Made up. "Hallucinated."

In PR, that's not just embarrassing. It's career-ending.

### The Distinction That Changes Everything

**Ungrounded AI:** Draws from its entire training data (the internet). Can say anything. Might be accurate. Might be completely fabricated.

**Grounded AI:** Only accesses sources you specifically provide. Can only work with what you give it. Dramatically reduced hallucination risk.

### How to Apply It

**For Client Research:**
- DON'T: Ask ChatGPT "Tell me about [Client Company]"
- DO: Upload the client's website, annual reports, and press releases to NotebookLM, then ask questions

**For Media Monitoring:**
- DON'T: Ask AI to summarize recent coverage (it might make things up)
- DO: Upload actual clips to a grounded tool, then analyze sentiment and themes

**For Competitive Analysis:**
- DON'T: Trust AI's claims about competitors
- DO: Gather real competitor materials, upload them, analyze with grounded tools

### The Tool Stack

| Use Case | Grounded Tool | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Client knowledge bases | NotebookLM | 50 free sources, citation tracking |
| Research synthesis | Perplexity | Real-time web search with sources |
| Document analysis | Claude with uploads | Large context window |
| Data extraction | ChatGPT with files | Good at structured output |

### The Key Quote

> "The difference between grounded and ungrounded AI is the difference between research and gambling."

PR professionals can't afford to gamble. Ground your AI work.

## Framework 2: The POP Framework

### Why Your Prompts Aren't Working

Most people prompt AI like they're texting a friend:

*"Write me a press release about our new product launch"*

And they get generic, useless output.

The problem isn't AI. It's the prompt.

### POP: Persona, Objective, Parameters

**Persona:** Who should the AI be?
- Not just "PR professional" but specific: "Senior PR strategist specializing in B2B technology launches with 15 years experience at top agencies"
- The more specific, the better the output

**Objective:** What exactly do you need?
- Not "write a press release" but "draft the first two paragraphs of a press release announcing our Q1 product launch, focusing on the differentiation from competitor X"
- Break big tasks into small, specific objectives

**Parameters:** What are the constraints?
- Tone: Professional but not stuffy
- Length: 250 words max
- Format: AP style
- Must include: Three specific quotes from these executives
- Must avoid: Jargon, hyperbole, unsubstantiated claims

### POP in Action: Media Pitch Example

**Bad Prompt:**
*"Write a pitch for my client's new sustainability initiative"*

**Good Prompt (POP Applied):**

*PERSONA: You are an experienced PR professional who has successfully pitched stories to Tier 1 business journalists. You understand that journalists receive hundreds of pitches daily and value concise, newsworthy angles.*

*OBJECTIVE: Draft a pitch email for [Reporter Name] at [Outlet] about my client's new carbon neutrality commitment. The pitch should lead with the news hook, provide context on why this matters now, and offer three specific story angles the journalist could take.*

*PARAMETERS:*
- *Length: Under 200 words (journalists skim)*
- *Tone: Respectful, not salesy*
- *Include: One relevant data point, one potential expert source beyond my client*
- *Avoid: PR jargon, superlatives, anything that sounds like marketing copy*

### The Transformation

When Allison Stout applied POP to her winery PR plans:

- **Before:** Generic strategies anyone could write
- **After:** "Really impressed with how comprehensive and actionable it was. Already implementing recommendations."

Time: 4-5 hours vs. 24-32 hours traditional.

That's 85% savings. On better work.

## Framework 3: The Collaborative Iteration Model

### The Mistake Everyone Makes

People treat AI like a vending machine:
1. Insert prompt
2. Receive output
3. Use output (or complain it's bad)

That's not how the best results happen.

### The Professional Model

**Draft → Refine → Reorganize → Iterate → Finalize**

Think of AI as a brilliant but inexperienced team member. They can produce volume quickly, but you provide the strategic direction, quality control, and final polish.

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Get the First Draft**
Let AI produce something—anything. Don't expect perfection.

**Step 2: Identify What's Working**
"Good structure. The third paragraph captures the tone. The opening needs work."

**Step 3: Targeted Refinement**
"Rewrite the opening to lead with the human impact story instead of the statistics."

**Step 4: Iterate**
Multiple rounds. Each one better than the last.

**Step 5: Human Polish**
Add your expertise, your voice, your judgment. This is where you earn your pay.

### Why This Works

> "AI is a great starting point, but you always need to add that human touch." — Allison Stout

> "Nobody's just taking whatever ChatGPT gives them and calling it a day. You're all using AI to augment your work, to make you more efficient, to help you do things that would be difficult or impossible to do on your own. But you're still bringing your expertise, your judgment, your creativity to the process." — Pete Pachal

### The Results

Collaborative iteration produces output that is:
- Faster than pure human effort
- Better quality than pure AI output
- More authentic than templates
- More scalable than manual work

The best of both worlds. That's the goal.

## Framework 4: The Template Multiplier Effect

### The Hidden Superpower

Here's what most people miss about AI for PR:

**First project: 10 hours**
**Second project: 4 hours**
**Third project: 2 hours**
**Tenth project: 30 minutes**

That's not linear improvement. That's exponential.

### How It Works

When Simone built her first interactive media monitoring dashboard:
- Time: 60-75 minutes
- Learning curve: Significant
- Client reaction: "They've loved it!"

Second dashboard:
- Time: 20-25 minutes
- Learning curve: None (template reuse)
- Quality: Even better (learned from first)

After that? ~90% component reuse. New dashboards in minutes.

### Building Your Template Library

**For Media Monitoring:**
1. Build one interactive dashboard
2. Document your prompt sequence
3. Save the template structure
4. Deploy across all clients (modify data, keep framework)

**For Coverage Recaps:**
1. Create one comprehensive recap format
2. Build the AI workflow once
3. Apply to every campaign

**For Strategic Plans:**
1. Develop your planning prompt sequence
2. Save the structure that works
3. Customize for each client (swap context, keep process)

### The Math

Traditional approach:
- 10 clients × 8 hours per report = 80 hours/month

Template multiplier approach:
- First template: 8 hours
- Remaining 9 clients: 9 × 1 hour = 9 hours
- Total: 17 hours/month

**Savings: 63 hours/month.** What would you do with 63 extra hours?

### The Business Impact

> "Communications professionals can now offer premium deliverables profitably, scale across client portfolios without proportional time increase."

That's not just efficiency. That's a new business model.

## Framework 5: The Interactive Deliverable Advantage

### The PDF Problem

Your clients are bored.

They receive your beautifully designed PDF reports and... skim them. Maybe.

> "So used to getting PDF reports they have to scroll through."

Sound familiar?

### The Transformation

What if instead of static reports, you delivered:
- Interactive dashboards they can explore
- Filterable data they can manipulate
- Self-service insights they can discover

### What This Looks Like

**Lizzie's Coverage Recap:**
- Before: PowerPoint/PDF
- After: Interactive website with sentiment visualization, filterable sections, client self-service

**Client Response:** "Best coverage recap they'd ever received."

**Simone's Media Monitoring:**
- Before: 6-hour manual process → static PDF
- After: 20-minute workflow → interactive dashboard

**Client Response:** "Now they can actually explore the data themselves."

### How to Build Interactive Deliverables

**The Tools (Late 2025):**
- Lovable.dev: Build web apps through natural language
- Gamma: Interactive presentations from prompts
- Claude Artifacts: Quick interactive prototypes

**The Process:**
1. Gather your data (spreadsheet, coverage clips, monitoring data)
2. Describe what you want to the tool
3. Iterate on the design
4. Deploy and share with clients

**Time Investment:**
- First build: 6-7 hours (including learning)
- Traditional alternative: "Weeks and thousands of dollars with a developer"

### The ROI

Lizzie's first interactive deliverable:
- Time invested: 6-7 hours
- Client perception: Dramatically elevated
- Differentiation: Significant vs. competitors sending PDFs

> "First deliverable savings exceeded the cost of course tuition."

ROI on project one. Everything after is profit.

## Putting It All Together

### The PR Pro's AI Workflow

1. **Ground your knowledge** (Framework 1)
   - Upload client materials to NotebookLM
   - Build grounded knowledge bases
   - Never work from unverified AI claims

2. **Structure your prompts** (Framework 2)
   - Apply POP to every significant request
   - Persona → Objective → Parameters
   - Specific inputs = specific outputs

3. **Iterate collaboratively** (Framework 3)
   - Draft → Refine → Reorganize → Iterate → Finalize
   - AI accelerates, you elevate
   - Human judgment is non-negotiable

4. **Build templates** (Framework 4)
   - Document what works
   - Reuse across clients
   - Efficiency compounds over time

5. **Deliver interactively** (Framework 5)
   - Move beyond static reports
   - Build exploratory experiences
   - Differentiate through format

### The Confidence Shift

Week 1: "Will clients think I'm cutting corners if I use AI?"

Week 6: "The client was blown away. Best they'd ever received."

That's the transformation. Not from fighting AI or fearing it.

From **building with it.**
