## EMAIL 1: THE REALITY CHECK

**Send:** Week -1 (Early Bird Launch)
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Your clients are already using ChatGPT"
- "The conversation happening without you"
- "What your clients fact-check against AI"

---

Hey there,

Kris Krug here. Founder of The Upgrade AI. I've spent the last two years training communications professionals—agency people, corporate comms teams, media companies—on how to actually work with AI.

I'm writing because you signed up to learn about AI Upgrade for PR & Communications. And I want to start with a truth bomb:

**Your clients are already using AI.**

Not in some vague future way. Right now. Today.

Angela Nibs, one of our students who runs a boutique PR agency, put it bluntly: "Clients fact-check our recommendations against ChatGPT."

Read that again.

Your clients are checking your work against AI. They're not telling you about it. But they're doing it.

Here's the thing: That's not a threat. It's an opportunity.

The PR professionals who understand how AI works—its capabilities, its limitations, its proper role—they're becoming more valuable, not less. Because they can:

- Explain why AI got something wrong
- Deliver things AI alone can't produce
- Use AI to work faster WITHOUT sacrificing quality
- Build interactive deliverables that blow clients away

That's what we teach. Over the next few days, I'll share exactly what the program covers and who it's for.

For now, one question:

**Are you ahead of your clients on AI, or are they ahead of you?**

Be honest. I'll write again soon.

— Kris

P.S. If you already know you want in, reply "READY" and I'll send the full details.

## EMAIL 2: THE HALLUCINATION PROBLEM

**Send:** Launch Week Day 1
**Subject Line Options:**
- "The AI mistake that ends careers"
- "Why most PR pros are using AI dangerously"
- "The hallucination problem (and how to solve it)"

---

Let me tell you what keeps PR professionals up at night.

It's not job displacement. Not really.

It's the fear of putting AI-generated information in front of a client—or worse, a journalist—and having it be **wrong.**

"Hallucinations" in AI speak. Made-up facts delivered with perfect confidence.

For most industries, that's embarrassing. For PR? It's career-ending.

I've watched hundreds of communications professionals grapple with this. Here's what I've learned:

**Most people try to solve the wrong problem.**

They think: "I need to find an AI that doesn't hallucinate."

That AI doesn't exist. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

The real solution is different: **Grounded tools.**

Here's the distinction that changes everything:

**Ungrounded AI** (like vanilla ChatGPT): Draws from its entire training data. Can say anything. Might be right. Might be completely fabricated.

**Grounded AI** (like NotebookLM with your sources): Only accesses materials you specifically provide. Can only work with what you give it. Dramatically reduced hallucination risk.

When you use grounded tools for client work, you're not trusting AI's imagination. You're trusting YOUR sources, with AI helping you synthesize them.

That's the difference between research and gambling.

PR professionals can't afford to gamble. We teach you not to.

Tomorrow I'll explain the full methodology—how to use AI for serious PR work without risking your reputation.

— Kris

P.S. One of our students, Simone, came in deeply concerned about confidentiality and AI. By Week 6, she'd deployed interactive dashboards to multiple clients—all while maintaining data security. The path exists. You just need to know it.

---

## EMAIL 3: THE GROUNDED APPROACH

**Send:** Launch Week Day 3
**Subject Line Options:**
- "The methodology serious PR pros use"
- "How to use AI without the risk"
- "The framework that changes everything"

---

Let me show you how the professionals do it.

Most AI courses teach you tools. "Here's ChatGPT. Here's how to prompt it. Good luck."

That's not what we do.

We teach frameworks that work regardless of which tool you use. Frameworks that will still work when the next generation of AI arrives. Frameworks built specifically for communications professionals.

**The POP Framework:**

Every effective AI interaction has three elements:

- **Persona:** Who should the AI be? (Not "PR pro" but "Senior crisis communications specialist with experience in [specific industry]")
- **Objective:** What exactly do you need? (Not "write a pitch" but "draft the opening paragraph of a pitch to [specific reporter] about [specific angle]")
- **Parameters:** What are the constraints? (Tone, length, format, must-include, must-avoid)

Generic prompts = generic outputs.
Specific prompts = useful outputs.

**The Grounded Research Stack:**

1. Use Perplexity for initial research (real-time, cited sources)
2. Upload key sources to NotebookLM (grounded synthesis)
3. Use ChatGPT for final output (structured writing)

Each tool for its strength. Reduced risk throughout.

**The Collaborative Iteration Model:**

AI is a great starting point. It's not a great ending point.

Draft → Refine → Reorganize → Iterate → Finalize

Your expertise stays central. AI accelerates the mechanical parts. Human judgment never gets outsourced.

**The result?**

Allison Stout used this approach for a winery PR plan:
- Time: 4-5 hours (vs. 24-32 traditional)
- Client response: "Really impressed with how comprehensive and actionable it was"
- Quality: "They've already started implementing recommendations"

85% time savings. Better output. Happy client.

That's not magic. It's methodology.

Next email: I'll walk you through exactly what you learn in 6 weeks.

— Kris

P.S. "AI is a great starting point, but you always need to add that human touch." That's Allison's summary of the whole approach. Simple. True. Transformative.

## EMAIL 5: THE TRANSFORMATIONS

**Send:** Week 2
**Subject Line Options:**
- "From 'cutting corners' to 'best ever received'"
- "What actually happens in 6 weeks"
- "The anxiety-to-confidence arc"

---

Let me tell you about Lizzie.

**Week 1:**
"Will clients think I'm cutting corners if I use AI?"

That was her fear. Maybe it's yours too.

**Week 6:**
She built an interactive coverage recap website—sentiment visualization, filterable sections, client self-service exploration.

Client response: **"Best coverage recap they'd ever received."**

Time invested: 6-7 hours.
Traditional alternative: Weeks and thousands of dollars with a developer.
Transparency: Full disclosure to client. Zero concern about process.

**That's the arc we see over and over.**

---

**Simone's Journey:**

Week 1: Concerned about confidentiality with sensitive client information
Week 6: Interactive media monitoring dashboards deployed to multiple clients

"They've loved it! They're so used to getting PDF reports that they have to scroll through, and now they can actually explore the data themselves."

First dashboard: 60-75 minutes
Second dashboard: 20-25 minutes (template reuse)
After that: ~90% component reuse

---

**Eric's Journey:**

Came in as communications lead at Roblox (25-person global team).
Challenge: Individual AI use is easy. Team-wide adoption is hard.

Capstone: Comprehensive AI playbook for his communications team.
Result: Enterprise-wide AI transformation initiated from course learning.

---

**Allison Grant's Journey:**

Wanted to create kids' educational content (Story Trains).
Problem: Traditional production cost $4,000-9,000 per episode. Impossible for solo creator.

Built: End-to-end AI production pipeline (scripts + voice + animation).
Cost: ~$7-12 per episode.

"Completely impossible for me to create on my own before AI."

---

**Kyle's Innovation:**

Developed synthetic audience simulation for crisis message testing.
Concept: Build 4 customer personas → Scale to 4,000 synthetic audience members → Test crisis messages before deployment.

My reaction: "It's freaking genius."

Know how your messaging lands before it goes live.

---

These aren't unicorns. They're PR and communications professionals who committed to 6 weeks and built something real.

What would YOUR transformation story be?

## EMAIL 6: LAST CALL

**Send:** Week 3 (Close)
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Final call: doors close [DATE]"
- "This is the last email"
- "The choice you're making"

---

This is my last email about this cohort.

Enrollment closes in [X hours].

I want to be straight with you about what's at stake.

**Six weeks from now, you'll be somewhere.**

**Option A:** Building interactive deliverables that blow clients away. Using grounded tools that eliminate hallucination risk. Confidently advising your team and clients on AI. Part of a community of PR professionals who get it.

**Option B:** Exactly where you are now. Same uncertainty. Same anxiety. Watching colleagues and competitors adapt while you figure it out alone.

The gap between those futures is one decision.

---

**I know the objections:**

"I don't have time."
90 minutes a week. That's it. And the course SAVES time. Students report hours recovered weekly after applying what they learn.

"It's expensive."
It's priced less than one day of a freelancer's time. Lizzie's first deliverable savings exceeded course tuition. ROI on project one.

"I'll figure it out on my own."
Maybe. Or maybe you'll still be saying that a year from now. The course provides structure, methodology, and accountability. That's why people finish.

"I'm worried about confidentiality."
So was Simone. We teach you to use AI safely—grounded tools, public data when appropriate, secure practices. The path exists.

"My clients might judge me."
Lizzie thought that too. Then she heard "best ever received." Transparency + quality = trust.

---

**Here's what I know:**

The PR professionals winning right now aren't hiding from AI.
They aren't competing with AI.
They're building with AI.

I've created a place where you can learn to do that. With methodology. With community. With real outcomes.

The door closes on [DATE] at [TIME].

**[SECURE YOUR SPOT]**

---

If this isn't right for you, I respect that. Unsubscribe and no hard feelings.

But if you've been waiting for a sign, consider this it.

Your clients are already using AI.
The question is whether you're ahead of them or behind.

— Kris

P.S. Still have a question? Reply right now. I'll answer before enrollment closes. That's a promise.
