## COHORT 3 STORIES (September-October 2025)

### 1. Lizzie — From "Cutting Corners" Fear to "Best Ever Received"

**Background:**
- PR professional handling post-campaign coverage recaps
- Traditionally delivered PowerPoint or PDF reports
- Initial concern about client perception of AI use

**The Fear (Week 1):**
> "Will clients think I'm cutting corners if I use AI?"

**The Transformation:**
- **Week 5:** Discovered Lovable.dev for interactive web experiences
- **Week 6:** Built interactive coverage recap website with:
  - Sentiment visualization
  - Filterable sections
  - Client self-service exploration
- **Time invested:** 6-7 hours (including learning curve)
- **Traditional alternative:** "Weeks and thousands of dollars" with a developer

**The Outcome:**
> "The client was blown away. They said it was the **best coverage recap they'd ever received.**"

**Key Decision:**
Disclosed AI use (ChatGPT for sentiment analysis, Lovable for dashboard). Client focused entirely on deliverable quality—zero concern about process.

**Peer Validation:**
> "Lizzie, I love this so much. I'm definitely going to steal this idea for my own client work." — Allison Stout

**ROI:**
First deliverable savings exceeded course tuition cost.
