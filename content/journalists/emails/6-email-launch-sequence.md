# AI Upgrade for Journalists: 6-Email Launch Sequence
## Complete Nurture Funnel from Awareness to Enrollment

---

## SEQUENCE OVERVIEW

**Purpose:** Convert leads from playbook download to program enrollment
**Timing:** 14 days from download to final CTA
**Tone:** Peer-to-peer, industry insider, solution-focused
**Goal:** 3-5% conversion to enrollment

---

## EMAIL 1: THE WELCOME & VALUE DELIVERY

**Send:** Immediately upon playbook download

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Your AI Journalist Playbook is ready"
- "Here's your playbook (plus what nobody tells you about AI in newsrooms)"
- "The playbook is attached—start with page 3"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Your playbook is attached.

If you only have 10 minutes, start with Part 1: The AI-Augmented Research Workflow. That's where most journalists see immediate impact.

But here's what the playbook doesn't cover:

**The real question isn't whether AI can help journalists.**

Every major newsroom is already using it. NYT, WaPo, Reuters, AP—they've all integrated AI into their workflows.

The real question is whether you'll learn these tools on your own, struggle through trial and error, or learn them systematically with people who've already figured it out.

That's what we do at The Upgrade. We take journalists from wherever they are with AI to building production-ready workflows in 6 weeks.

Not theory. Not demos. Actual tools you'll use every day.

More on that in the next few emails. For now, dig into the playbook.

And hit reply if you have questions—I read every response.

Kris

P.S. — Page 7 has the Document Processor prompt. If you've ever gotten a massive FOIA response, that one alone is worth the download.

## EMAIL 2: THE INDUSTRY REALITY

**Send:** Day 2

**Subject Line Options:**
- "The newsroom divide is already happening"
- "What your competitors aren't telling you"
- "Some newsrooms will survive. Some won't."

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Let me tell you what I'm seeing in newsrooms right now.

**Group A:** Journalists who are quietly using AI for research, drafts, transcription, fact-checking. They're producing more, faster, with fewer errors. They're not talking about it publicly because they don't want competitors to catch on.

**Group B:** Journalists who think AI is hype, or who tried ChatGPT once and decided it wasn't useful. They're still working the old way. They don't understand why Group A keeps beating them to stories.

The gap between these groups is widening every month.

Here's the thing: Group A isn't necessarily more talented. They just figured out how to use better tools.

That's what makes this moment different from previous disruptions. This isn't about being younger, or more tech-savvy, or having a bigger budget.

It's about learning specific skills that compound over time.

The playbook you downloaded is a start. But learning from a document is hard. Learning with expert guidance and a cohort of peers? That's how transformation actually happens.

Tomorrow, I'll share some specific results from journalists who've gone through our program.

Talk soon,

Kris

## EMAIL 3: THE TRANSFORMATION PROOF

**Send:** Day 4

**Subject Line Options:**
- "From 4 hours of research to 45 minutes"
- "What Marcus built after getting laid off"
- "These journalists changed everything in 6 weeks"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Let me introduce you to a few journalists:

**Sarah** was an investigative reporter drowning in document review. 5,000 pages of public records, competitors circling the same story. After learning our document processing workflow, she found patterns in an afternoon that would have taken weeks manually. Story published 3 weeks ahead of competition.

**Marcus** got laid off from his fourth newsroom. 15 years of healthcare policy expertise, but no platform. After the program, he launched a newsletter that now has 3,200 subscribers and earns more than his old salary. AI handles 80% of the production.

**Jennifer** was a breaking news reporter burning out on the pace. Now her AI-augmented workflow handles background research before she even picks up the phone. Story turnaround down 40%. Zero corrections in 6 months.

These aren't theoretical benefits.

These are journalists who spent 6 weeks learning systematic AI skills and came out transformed.

Same talent. Same instincts. Better tools.

If you're curious about what the program actually looks like, I'll break that down in my next email.

Kris

P.S. — Marcus said something that stuck with me: "The program didn't just teach me AI tools. It taught me that my beat expertise has value beyond a byline."

## EMAIL 4: THE PROGRAM BREAKDOWN

**Send:** Day 7

**Subject Line Options:**
- "What actually happens in 6 weeks"
- "The AI Upgrade curriculum (unfiltered)"
- "Here's exactly what you'd learn"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

You asked (or you're wondering): What actually happens in the AI Upgrade for Journalists?

Here's the honest breakdown:

**Week 1-2: Research Transformation**
You'll build an AI research assistant trained on your beat. By the end of week 2, background research that used to take 4 hours takes 45 minutes. And it's more comprehensive.

**Week 3: Writing Workflow**
You'll create a writing style GPT that knows your voice—your sentence rhythms, word choices, structural preferences. It drafts in your style for you to edit. Blank page problem: solved.

**Week 4: Verification Systems**
You'll build a fact-checking workflow that flags every claim, suggests verification paths, and tracks what's been confirmed. Zero corrections becomes possible.

**Week 5: Content Multiplication**
One story becomes five outputs—newsletter, social, podcast, more. AI handles the reformatting. You maintain the voice. Your work goes further.

**Week 6: Capstone Project**
You'll ship a production tool that you'll actually use. Not a demo. Something that changes your daily workflow.

Class size is small (12-15 people). The cohort includes journalists from major outlets and independents building their own platforms. You learn from each other as much as from us.

Next email: Who this is actually for (and who it's not for).

## EMAIL 5: THE QUALIFICATION

**Send:** Day 10

**Subject Line Options:**
- "This isn't for everyone"
- "The uncomfortable truth about who succeeds"
- "Don't apply if this describes you"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Let me be direct about who this program is for:

**It's for you if:**
- You're a working journalist (staff or freelance)
- You've tried AI tools but haven't figured out a systematic approach
- You're willing to put in 3-4 hours per week for 6 weeks
- You want to build real tools, not just learn concepts
- You can invest in your career right now

**It's probably not for you if:**
- You're happy with your current workflow
- You don't believe AI has a role in journalism
- You want someone to tell you AI is bad
- You're looking for a quick fix
- You can't commit the time

The journalists who get the most from this program are the ones who arrive with a specific problem they want to solve.

"I spend too much time on research."
"I can't keep up with content demands."
"I need to launch a newsletter but can't find the hours."
"I want to build beat expertise faster."

If you have a problem like that, this program solves it.

If you don't, you probably don't need us.

One more email coming with enrollment details and timing.

Kris

P.S. — Remember Marcus from Email 3? He almost didn't apply because he wasn't sure he could afford it after the layoff. He says it's the best investment he's made in his career. Sometimes the timing that feels worst is actually perfect.
