## INTRODUCTION: JOURNALISM'S AI MOMENT

Every major newsroom is using AI. The New York Times, Washington Post, Reuters, AP—they're all integrating artificial intelligence into their workflows. Not in some distant future. Right now.

But here's what most journalists get wrong: They think AI is about replacement. It's not. It's about augmentation.

The mechanical parts of journalism—transcription, first drafts, data processing, research synthesis—these can be automated. The human parts—source relationships, editorial judgment, investigative instincts, storytelling—these cannot.

The journalists who will thrive in this environment are the ones who understand the difference. Who learn to leverage AI for what it does well, so they can focus on what only humans can do.

This playbook shows you how.

## PART 1: THE AI-AUGMENTED RESEARCH WORKFLOW

### The Old Way vs. The New Way

**Traditional Research (4+ hours):**
1. Google the topic
2. Open 50 browser tabs
3. Read 20 articles manually
4. Take scattered notes
5. Try to synthesize patterns
6. Miss connections anyway

**AI-Augmented Research (45 minutes):**
1. "Synthesize all public information about [topic]"
2. Review AI synthesis for gaps
3. Targeted deep dives on key questions
4. Pattern recognition across sources
5. Interview preparation generated automatically

Same rigor. Different speed.

### Tool #1: The Research Synthesizer

**The Prompt:**
```
You are a research assistant for an investigative journalist.
Analyze all publicly available information about [TOPIC].

Provide:
1. Timeline of key events
2. Major players and their relationships
3. Claims that need verification
4. Contradictions between sources
5. Questions that haven't been asked
6. Suggested interview subjects
```

**What You Get:**
A comprehensive research briefing that would have taken days to compile manually.

**Your Job:**
Verify the synthesis. Identify gaps. Pursue the leads that matter.

### Tool #2: The Document Processor

When you get a FOIA response with 5,000 pages:

**The Prompt:**
```
Analyze this document collection and identify:
1. All named individuals and their roles
2. Financial transactions over $X
3. Timeline of key events
4. Inconsistencies or anomalies
5. Connections between entities
6. The 50 most important pages
```

**What Changes:**
Weeks of manual review become one afternoon of targeted analysis.

### Tool #3: The Interview Prep Generator

Before every interview:

**The Prompt:**
```
Prepare me for an interview with [NAME].

Based on their public statements and history:
1. Key positions they've taken
2. Contradictions in their statements
3. Questions they've never been asked
4. Likely talking points they'll use
5. Follow-up questions for each scenario
```

**The Result:**
Walk into every interview over-prepared.

## PART 2: THE AI-AUGMENTED WRITING WORKFLOW

### Principle: AI Drafts, Humans Edit

The blank page is the enemy. AI eliminates it.

Your notes + AI = Starting point for editing

Not the final story. Never the final story. Just something to react to.

### Tool #4: The First Draft Generator

After reporting is complete:

**The Prompt:**
```
Based on these notes and interview transcripts, draft a [WORD COUNT] article.

Structure:
- Lead that hooks readers immediately
- Nut graf explaining why this matters
- Supporting evidence in order of importance
- Counterarguments addressed
- Strong kicker

Voice: [Your writing style description]
Audience: [Your publication's readers]
```

**What You Do:**
Edit aggressively. Add your voice. Verify every claim. Make it yours.

### Tool #5: The Headline Generator

One headline idea is never enough:

**The Prompt:**
```
Generate 20 headline options for this article:
[PASTE ARTICLE]

Include:
- 5 direct/informational headlines
- 5 question-based headlines
- 5 hook/curiosity headlines
- 5 quote-based headlines

Optimize for: [PLATFORM - print, web, social]
```

**Your Job:**
Pick the best one. Combine elements. Make it perfect.

### Tool #6: The Copy Editor

Before filing:

**The Prompt:**
```
Review this article for:
1. Grammar and style issues
2. Factual claims that need verification
3. Unclear passages
4. Structural improvements
5. AP Style compliance

Flag anything that needs human attention.
```

**The Result:**
Cleaner copy. Fewer corrections. Faster publication.

---

## PART 3: THE AI-AUGMENTED VERIFICATION WORKFLOW

### The Verification Checklist

Every claim. Every statistic. Every quote.

AI helps you track what's been verified and what hasn't.

### Tool #7: The Fact-Check Flagge

Before publication:

**The Prompt:**
```
Analyze this article and identify:
1. All factual claims that require verification
2. Statistics and their sources
3. Quotes that need confirmation
4. Legal review flags
5. Potential defamation concerns

For each item, suggest verification method.
```

**Your Job:**
Verify what AI flags. Add your judgment. Clear for publication.

### Tool #8: The Source Verifier

When you get a tip:

**The Prompt:**
```
This tip claims [CLAIM].

Check against public records:
1. Is this claim verifiable?
2. What public evidence exists?
3. Who else might confirm this?
4. What are the red flags?
5. Is this worth pursuing?
```

**The Result:**
10-minute assessment of tip viability instead of 10-hour wild goose chase.

## PART 4: THE CONTENT MULTIPLICATION SYSTEM

### The Modern Reality: One Story = Multiple Outputs

Your reporting has value beyond the article. AI helps you extract it.

**The Content Waterfall:**
1. One feature article (your core work)
2. Newsletter adaptation (AI reformats)
3. Social thread (AI extracts key points)
4. Podcast outline (AI structures for audio)
5. Video script (AI adapts for visual)

Same reporting. Five outputs. Maximum value.

### Tool #9: The Newsletter Converter

Take any article:

**The Prompt:**
```
Convert this article into a newsletter format:
1. Compelling subject line
2. Personal intro (conversational tone)
3. Key insights summarized
4. What this means for readers
5. Call to action

Maintain voice: [Your newsletter style]
Length: 500-700 words
```

### Tool #10: The Social Thread Generator

Same article:

**The Prompt:**
```
Convert this article into a Twitter/X thread:
1. Hook tweet (most surprising finding)
2. 5-7 supporting tweets (one idea each)
3. Context tweets (why this matters)
4. Closing tweet with CTA

Keep each under 280 characters.
Include natural thread connectors.
```

## PART 5: BUILDING YOUR AI TOOLKIT

### The Three Essential Custom GPTs

**1. Research Assistant GPT**
- Trained on your beat
- Knows your sources
- Understands your coverage area
- Synthesizes background automatically

**2. Writing Style GPT**
- Trained on your published work
- Captures your voice
- Matches your rhythm
- Drafts in your style

**3. Verification GPT**
- Knows your publication's standards
- Flags claims systematically
- Suggests verification paths

### Setting Up Your Knowledge Base

Essential documents to upload:
1. Your style guide
2. Your best published work (20+ articles)
3. Your source list (anonymized as needed)
4. Your beat briefing documents
5. Previous investigation notes

The better your knowledge base, the better your outputs.

---

## PART 6: THE ETHICS FRAMEWORK

### Disclosure Principles

1. **Always verify:** AI synthesis is a starting point, not a source
2. **Always disclose:** If AI contributed significantly, note it
3. **Always edit:** No AI output publishes without human review
4. **Always own:** Your byline means your responsibility

### What AI Should NOT Do

- Generate quotes (fabrication risk)
- Confirm facts (hallucination risk)
- Replace source relationships (human work)
- Make editorial judgments (journalist's job)

### What AI Should Do

- Accelerate research (with verification)
- Draft for editing (with heavy revision)
- Identify patterns (with human analysis)
- Multiply content (with voice preservation)

## CONCLUSION: THE AUGMENTED FUTURE

AI is not coming for journalism. It's already here.

The newsrooms that embrace it will move faster, break more stories, and serve their audiences better.

The newsrooms that ignore it will wonder why they keep losing.

This isn't about replacement. It's about evolution.

The fundamental values haven't changed:
- Truth matters
- Sources matter
- Verification matters
- Storytelling matters

What's changed is the speed at which we can honor those values.

AI is a tool. The most powerful tool journalism has gained in decades.

Use it wisely.
