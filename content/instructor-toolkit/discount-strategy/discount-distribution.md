## 🎯 Best Practices for Distribution

### Do's:

✅ **Personalize Inner Circle emails** (mention specific connection)
✅ **Segment your audience** (don't spam everyone with everything)
✅ **Share authentic stories** (real student transformations)
✅ **Follow up** (people need 3-5 touches to convert)
✅ **Be transparent** (students know you're an instructor)
✅ **Track your codes** (know what's working)
✅ **Combine channels** (email + LinkedIn + blog = best results)

### Don'ts:

❌ **Blast everyone at once** (tier your outreach strategically)
❌ **Copy-paste without customizing** (templates are starting points)
❌ **Oversell** (let results speak, don't hype)
❌ **Spam** (respect unsubscribes and non-responses)
❌ **Forget to follow up** (most conversions happen in follow-up)
❌ **Ignore tracking** (data drives optimization)
❌ **Discount too deeply** (protect program value)

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall #1: Code Sharing Abuse
**Problem:** Inner Circle codes shared publicly, devaluing program
**Solution:**
- Limit code uses (2-3 max)
- Monitor redemptions, deactivate if abused
- Clearly state "For [Name] and one referral only"

### Pitfall #2: Discount Fatigue
**Problem:** Constant discounts train audience to wait for deals
**Solution:**
- Clear start/end dates on all codes
- Don't extend discounts beyond announced deadline
- Occasionally run full-price cohorts

### Pitfall #3: Poor Tracking
**Problem:** Can't attribute enrollments to specific efforts
**Solution:**
- Use unique codes per instructor + tier + quarter
- Update tracking sheet weekly
- Review data before next campaign

### Pitfall #4: Generic Outreach
**Problem:** Templated emails feel spammy, get ignored
**Solution:**
- Customize first line of every Inner Circle email
- Reference specific past interactions
- Vary subject lines, don't reuse

### Pitfall #5: Ignoring Non-Converters
**Problem:** One-time outreach misses future opportunities
**Solution:**
- Add non-converters to nurture list
- Invite to free webinars/office hours
- Re-engage next quarter with new stories
