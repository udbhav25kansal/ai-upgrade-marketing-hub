## 🎓 Your Teaching Philosophy

### "Few Weeks Ahead" = Sufficient Expertise

**Your unique approach:**
> "I was in reality just probably a few weeks ahead of them experimenting"

This democratizes expertise and removes impostor syndrome. You don't need to be the world's leading AI researcher—you just need to be a few weeks ahead and willing to share what you're learning.

### Three-Stage Methodology

**Your framework that works:**
1. **Awareness** → Understanding AI capabilities and limitations
2. **Experimentation** → Hands-on practice with real tools
3. **Integration** → Incorporating AI into daily workflows

**Use this arc in all content—it's your signature teaching model.**
