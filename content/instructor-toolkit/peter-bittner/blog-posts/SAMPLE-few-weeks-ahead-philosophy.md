## The Confession

When I started teaching AI in 2019, I had what I can only describe as an impostor syndrome crisis.

I wasn't a machine learning researcher. I hadn't trained models. I didn't have a PhD in computer science.

I was a journalist who'd spent five years in Mongolia and somehow ended up teaching multimedia at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism.

The 2019 syllabus title: "Future of Visual Storytelling."

My internal reaction: **"What the hell is this? I had no reference point at all."**

At the time, AI was theoretical. No consumer tech to use. Just "standup websites with pre-recorded demos." You had to squint—maybe be a few drinks down—to believe this would be remotely impactful.

Then November 2022 happened. ChatGPT launched.

Alumni started asking: "Can you teach us this?"

Here's the crucial realization I had:

**I was in reality just probably a few weeks ahead of them experimenting.**

And you know what? That was enough. More than enough.

## The "Few Weeks Ahead" Philosophy

This became my teaching philosophy.

You don't need to be the world's leading AI researcher to help others learn AI.

You don't need a PhD.

You don't need to understand transformer architecture or backpropagation.

You just need to be **a few weeks ahead** and willing to share what you're learning.

This principle democratizes expertise in a profound way.

It means:
- Professionals can upskill without becoming computer scientists
- Teachers can guide without claiming omniscience
- Learning happens collaboratively, not hierarchically
- Impostor syndrome loses its power

**If you've spent three weeks experimenting with AI tools, you can help someone in week one.**

That's the entire premise of AI Upgrade.

## We're In the First Inning

A lot of people are disappointed right now.

"Isn't AI just a hype bubble? GPT-5 sucked, right? Does anyone love ChatGPT-5 the same way they loved 4?"

I get it. The hype cycle is exhausting.

But here's the reality: **We are still in the first inning.**

Dr. Roy Amara said it best:

> "We tend to overestimate the effect of technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run."

This is where we are.

Short-term: People expected AGI. They're disappointed.

Long-term: Even if models don't improve, knowledge work has already fundamentally changed.

**If the models don't get any better than they are today in November 2025, our world has already changed.**

The world may not know it yet. But generative AI is already revolutionizing knowledge work.

William Gibson: **"The future is here, it's just unevenly distributed."**

The question is: Which side of that distribution are you on?

## What Actually Happens in Six Weeks

I've taught seven cohorts now. Over 150 professionals across creative industries, sales, journalism, healthcare, HR, and legal.

Here's the pattern I see every single time:

### Week 1: Awareness Stage

Fear. Uncertainty. Questions like:
- "Will AI replace my job?"
- "Will clients think I'm cutting corners?"
- "What if I lose my creative identity?"

These are real concerns. I take them seriously.

But I also introduce them to AI's actual capabilities and limitations. Not the hype. Not the doomerism. Just what these tools can actually do today.

We cover:
- The three paradigm shifts (Google → YouTube → AI)
- AI weaknesses you MUST understand (hallucinations, bias, sycophancy)
- When to use AI heavily vs. sparingly vs. not at all
- Building a personal AI policy

By end of Week 1, students understand AI isn't magic. It's not a threat. It's a tool with specific use cases.

### Week 3: Experimentation Stage

Hands-on practice. Breakout rooms. Live demonstrations.

This is where frameworks become crucial.

**The POP Framework:**
- **Persona:** Who should the AI be?
- **Objective:** What exactly do you need?
- **Parameters:** What are the constraints?

Generic prompts get generic outputs. Specific prompts get useful outputs.

We also introduce grounded vs. ungrounded tools:

**Ungrounded AI** (like vanilla ChatGPT): Draws from entire training data. Might be right. Might be completely fabricated.

**Grounded AI** (like NotebookLM with your sources): Only accesses materials you provide. Dramatically reduced hallucination risk.

For professionals who can't afford to gamble with accuracy—PR pros, lawyers, healthcare workers—this distinction is everything.

### Week 6: Integration Stage

Students present their capstones.

Not just demos. Working tools they've built and will continue using.

**What they've built:**
- Interactive coverage recaps (replaced static PDFs)
- Media monitoring dashboards (replaced 6-hour manual process)
- Crisis message simulation tools (test before deployment)
- Journalist research systems (30 minutes → 3 minutes)
- Contract analysis tools (109 cases in 6 hours, not 6 weeks)

These aren't unicorns. These are professionals who committed to six weeks and built something real.

**The transformation:**
- Cohort 1: Identity crisis → Disclosure frameworks
- Cohort 2: Systematic ethics → Pre-mortem methodology
- Cohort 6: Production deployment → Businesses launched

Exploration → Integration → Deployment.

That's the arc.

## Students Build What We Could Only Have Dreamt Of

Here's what humbles me most:

**Students by the end of six weeks are able to build stuff that we could only have dreamt of.**

Honestly. Things that would have been too audacious for us to even propose.

**Why does this happen?**

They start fresh. No preconceptions about what's "too hard" or "requires a developer."

They combine domain expertise (years of professional experience) with AI tools (weeks of learning).

They get two coaching sessions to remove blockers.

They have a cohort of peers doing the same thing—collaboration and competition.

And they have a capstone deadline that forces shipping.

**Examples:**

**Armin Layegh** came in exploring AI. Left with TalentNow—a business with three paying clients by Week 6.

**Udbhav Kansal** went from "interested in AI" to 3rd place NASA Global Hackathon.

**Rob Rosenberg** (Paramount+) built three production tools for the GOAT mascot campaign. Deployed globally. Used by the entire team.

**Lawrence Alexander** analyzed 109 Indigenous court cases for Indigenomics Institute in 6 hours. Traditional approach: 6 weeks.

These weren't coding experts. They were professionals who learned to articulate what they needed, and the AI built the scaffolding.

## The Methodology That Transfers

One of the biggest mistakes in AI education: Teaching specific tools instead of transferable principles.

Tools will change. ChatGPT-7 will replace ChatGPT-4. New platforms will emerge. Old ones will die.

**What won't change:**

**1. The POP Framework**
Works across any text-based AI platform. Persona, Objective, Parameters. Master this once, use it forever.

**2. Grounded vs. Ungrounded Thinking**
Understanding when to trust AI outputs vs. when to verify rigorously. This principle transfers.

**3. Platform-Agnostic Approach**
We teach students to evaluate tools based on their strengths, not brand loyalty. Different tools for different tasks.

**4. The Three-Stage Arc**
Awareness → Experimentation → Integration. This works for any emerging technology, not just AI.

When GPT-6 comes out, our students won't need a new course. They'll apply the same frameworks to evaluate and adopt it.

That's the point.

## Evidence-Based Optimism

I'm often asked: "Are you worried about AI replacing jobs?"

Here's what the data actually shows:

**Pew Research:** AI experts are optimistic about AI's impact. The general public is ambivalent. The difference? **Knowledge.**

People who understand AI see opportunity. People who don't see threat.

AI literacy is becoming as fundamental as digital literacy was 20 years ago.

**20 years ago:** Digital literacy (email, Office, internet) was a differentiator.

**Today:** Digital literacy is assumed baseline.

**Next 5 years:** AI literacy will become assumed baseline.

Professionals without AI skills will be disadvantaged. Not because AI replaces them, but because AI-augmented professionals outcompete them.

**The entry-level crisis is real:**

Recent Ivy League graduates struggle to find first jobs because AI now handles tasks traditionally reserved for internships and first-year positions.

But professionals with AI skills? Coming out strong. High demand. Multiple opportunities.

**Work transforms, it doesn't disappear.**

Tasks get automated. Roles get augmented. Human judgment becomes more valuable, not less.

## What You'll Actually Learn (Not Just Consume)

AI Upgrade isn't about watching me demo tools for six weeks.

It's about you building something real.

**The structure:**

**Week 1:** Foundations, ethics, policy. The stuff you need to not be dangerous.

**Week 2:** AI assistants and advanced prompting. The POP Framework. Build a custom GPT for your workflow.

**Week 3:** Grounded tools and deep research. NotebookLM mastery. Reduce hallucination risk to near-zero.

**Week 4:** Capstone ideation and data analysis. Your project direction gets personalized coaching.

**Week 5:** Vibe coding and interactive deliverables. Build things without traditional coding.

**Week 6:** Capstone presentations. Show and tell extravaganza. You ship.

**You also get:**
- Two one-on-one coaching sessions (one with me, one with Kris)
- Slack community for ongoing support
- Frameworks that transfer to any platform
- A cohort of professionals on the same journey

## The Work Evolution, Not Replacement Narrative

Let me be direct about the fear:

"Will AI replace my job?"

The honest answer: It depends.

**AI will not replace professionals who understand how to use AI.**

**AI will replace professionals who don't.**

More specifically:

**What AI replaces:**
- Repetitive, mechanical tasks
- Initial draft generation
- Data processing and synthesis
- Pattern recognition at scale

**What AI augments:**
- Strategic thinking
- Creative judgment
- Client relationship management
- Complex problem-solving
- Taste and aesthetic decisions

**Knowledge workers before AI:** 80% mechanical execution, 20% creative decisions

**Knowledge workers with AI:** 20% execution, 80% creative decisions

That's not a threat. That's the job most of us wanted when we entered our fields.

## Who This Is For

**This program is for you if:**

✅ You're a professional who feels AI looming but don't know where to start

✅ You tried ChatGPT, got mediocre outputs, gave up

✅ You want systematic training, not scattered YouTube tutorials

✅ You're willing to build something, not just consume content

✅ You value frameworks over button-clicking

✅ You're curious but skeptical (good—skepticism is healthy)

**This is not for you if:**

❌ You think AI will do everything and you'll just supervise

❌ You're not willing to experiment and iterate

❌ You want theoretical knowledge without practical application

❌ You're looking for a magic solution that removes the need for expertise

AI doesn't replace domain expertise. It amplifies it.

Your professional knowledge becomes more valuable when combined with AI literacy.

## The Quarterly Reinvention Model

Here's something most courses don't do:

**We redo the curriculum every single quarter.**

Everything's different. Every single time.

Why?

- Tools come out in real time
- Models evolve constantly
- Student needs shift based on cohort feedback
- Best practices emerge from previous capstones

Cohort 1 learned PRECISE prompting. Cohort 7 learns POP (simplified).

Cohort 2 introduced pre-mortem methodology. Cohort 6 introduced vibe coding.

This isn't a static course. It's a living methodology that evolves with the technology.

Students don't get stale content. They get what works right now.

## Questions?

I read every email.

If you're uncertain whether this is right for you, ask.

If you have questions about the methodology, reach out.

If you think I'm underselling the difficulty or overselling the outcomes, challenge me.

The worst thing you can do is stay on the sidelines because you're unsure.

Seven cohorts in, I've seen the transformation arc dozens of times.

**Week 1:** "Who are we if AI does our work?"

**Week 6:** Deployed tools. Shipped projects. Transformed workflows.

The pattern is consistent. The outcomes are measurable.

---

## One Final Thought

I still describe myself as "few weeks ahead" of my students.

Not because I lack confidence. But because it's true—and it's the point.

AI is evolving so quickly that no one is an expert in the traditional sense.

We're all learning. The question is: Are you learning systematically or scrambling reactively?

Systematic learning beats scattered experimentation.

Frameworks beat random tool exploration.

Community beats isolation.

Capstones beat passive consumption.

That's what we offer.

See you in the cohort.
