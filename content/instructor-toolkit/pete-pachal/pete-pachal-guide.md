## 🎯 Your Teaching Philosophy

### Agency Through Natural Language Prompting

**Your core message:**
> "You don't have to surrender to AI's weaknesses. You have agency through natural language prompting."

This resonates with media professionals who feel AI is happening to them, not for them.

### Grounded vs. Ungrounded Tools (Your Signature Distinction)

**This is YOUR framework. Own it.**

**Ungrounded AI** (ChatGPT, vanilla use):
- Draws from entire training data
- Can hallucinate facts with perfect confidence
- Career-ending for journalists/PR pros

**Grounded AI** (NotebookLM, Perplexity with sources):
- Only uses materials you provide
- Cites sources
- Dramatically reduced hallucination risk

**For media professionals, this isn't academic. This is survival.**

One made-up fact in front of a journalist? Career over.

One hallucinated client detail in a pitch? Trust destroyed.

You teach the tools and workflows that prevent this.
