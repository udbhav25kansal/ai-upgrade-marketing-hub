## POST 1: The Bathtub Builder

It's 9:40am.

I'm in the bathtub.

I just built a BCAI awards nomination website.

From voice prompt to deployed website in 20 minutes.

This isn't normal. But it should be.

Welcome to vibe coding—where creative professionals prototype ideas before coffee, iterate by feel, and ship before lunch.

Dimitri dropped out of coding school. Six weeks later, he's building functional web apps. Not with code. With vibe.

That's what we teach in AI Upgrade for Creative Professionals.

Next cohort: [DATE]. Enrollment open now.

DM me for early bird access (20% off for my inner circle).

## POST 2: The Question Everyone's Asking

"Will clients think I'm cutting corners if I use AI?"

That was Lizzie's fear in Week 1.

Week 6: She built an interactive coverage recap website—sentiment visualization, filterable sections, client self-service.

Client response: "Best coverage recap they'd ever received."

Time invested: 6-7 hours.
Traditional alternative: Weeks + thousands of dollars with a developer.

She wasn't cutting corners. She was using a power tool instead of hand tools.

That's the difference.

AI Upgrade for Creative Professionals teaches you to use AI without losing your soul.

6 weeks. 2 coaching sessions. 1 capstone project you actually ship.

## POST 3: Your Clients Are Already Using It

Uncomfortable truth:

Your clients fact-check your recommendations against ChatGPT.

They're not telling you. But they're doing it.

So you have two choices:

Option A: Ignore AI. Hope it goes away. Get fact-checked by clients who know more than you.

Option B: Learn how AI works—its capabilities, limitations, and proper role. Become the expert your clients need.

Creative professionals winning right now aren't hiding from AI.

They aren't competing with AI.

They're building with AI.

Next AI Upgrade cohort for Creative Professionals starts [DATE].

## POST 4: What Actually Matters Now

If you're a creative professional in 2025, here's what separates those crushing it from those struggling:

**What doesn't matter anymore:**
❌ Memorizing software shortcuts
❌ Hand-coding every pixel
❌ Waiting for developers to implement your vision
❌ Spending 80% of time on mechanical tasks

**What matters more than ever:**
✅ Taste (knowing what's good vs. garbage)
✅ Vision (articulating what you want)
✅ Iteration speed (trying ten ideas instead of one)
✅ Human judgment (AI outputs faux work product constantly)
✅ Original intelligence (you're the intelligence, AI is the amplifier)

AI doesn't replace creative professionals.

It replaces the parts of creative work that suck.

The repetitive, mechanical, soul-crushing busy work? That's what dies.

The creative, strategic, human-judgment-requiring work? That's what grows.

Want to learn how to focus on the work you actually got into this field to do?

AI Upgrade for Creative Professionals. 6 weeks. Real frameworks. Shipped projects.

## POST 5: The Skills You Already Have (And How AI Amplifies Them)

I spent 20 years learning photography, composition, color theory, visual storytelling, client management, project scoping.

None of that is wasted. All of that informs how I use AI.

The difference:

Before: 80% mechanical execution, 20% creative decisions
Now: 20% execution, 80% creative decisions

That's not a threat. That's the job we always wanted.

Every cohort starts with the same fear:

"Is everything I learned obsolete?"

No. Everything you learned is substrate.

Your creative expertise, your taste, your understanding of what makes work good—that all matters MORE, not less.

AI just handles the parts that don't require your unique creative intelligence.

Next cohort of AI Upgrade for Creative Professionals: [DATE]

Taught by me and Peter Bittner (Mongolia journalist → Berkeley professor → "few weeks ahead" AI educator).

Max [X] students. When it's full, it's full.

## POST 6: Transformation Arc (Matthew's Story)

Matthew Schwartzman joined AI Upgrade Cohort 1 at 17 years old.

By the end, he'd founded the Surrey AI community.

Regional ecosystem builder. At 17.

That's what happens when you give someone frameworks, coaching, and permission to experiment.

Not just consume content. Not just watch demos. Actually BUILD something.

Seven cohorts later, I've watched this pattern repeat:

Week 1: Fear and uncertainty. "Who are we if AI does our creative work?"

Week 3: Experimentation and discovery. "Oh, this is useful for [specific thing]."

Week 6: Deployed tools. Shipped projects. Transformed workflows.

Armin launched TalentNow—3 paying clients by Week 6.

Udbhav went from "interested in AI" to 3rd place NASA Global Hackathon.

Rob (Paramount+) deployed 3 production tools globally for GOAT mascot campaign.

In 6 weeks.

AI Upgrade for Creative Professionals isn't about learning tools.

It's about becoming the creative professional who knows how to build in the AI era.
