## 💡 Pro Tips from Past Campaigns

### What Worked Best:

✅ **Personal emails to Inner Circle = 60% conversion**
- Spend time on these
- Mention specific past interactions
- Keep it real, not salesy

✅ **LinkedIn posts with real student names = 3x engagement**
- Tag students (with permission)
- Use actual outcomes, not generic
- First-person stories resonate

✅ **Blog posts published early = longer traffic tail**
- Week -3 blog gets more total views
- SEO takes time to kick in
- Evergreen value beyond campaign

### What to Avoid:

❌ Blasting everyone at once (tier your outreach)
❌ Generic copy-paste without personalization
❌ Forgetting to follow up (most conversions in follow-up)
❌ Extending discounts past announced deadline (trains waiting)
❌ Ignoring tracking data (can't optimize what you don't measure)
