# Bathtub Vibe Coding: How I Built a Website Before Coffee

It's 9:40am.

I'm in the bathtub.

I just built a BCAI awards nomination website.

No, I'm not having a breakdown. This is just Tuesday now.

## Welcome to the Third Trip Around the Sun

I've lived through three major tech revolutions in my career.

**Web 1.0:** Building websites with code you typed character by character. Hours to make a button change color.

**Web 2.0:** WordPress, Squarespace, templates. Drag, drop, done. Democratized web creation.

**AI Era:** Tell a machine what you want. It builds it. You push buttons, tweak the vibe, ship it.

The coolest thing about vibe coding? What you think you want to build isn't really what you want to build.

By building it and fucking with it and pushing the buttons and going through the flows, you're like, "Oh, this is what I actually need."

That's not a bug. That's the entire point.

## What Happened to "Learn to Code"?

Remember when we told creative professionals they needed to learn to code?

Dimitri spent 13 years as a graphic designer. Tried coding school. Dropped out. Not his thing.

Six weeks in my AI Upgrade cohort? He's building functional web apps.

Not with code. With vibe.

He describes what he wants. The AI builds the scaffolding. He tweaks the aesthetics. It responds. Back and forth until the vibe is right.

Then he ships it.

That's not "low-code" or "no-code." That's a completely different creative process. One that actually matches how creative brains work.

## The Bathtub Test

Here's my standard for whether AI has actually changed creative work:

**Can you prototype an idea in the bathtub before coffee?**

If the answer is no, we're still in the old world. Ideas require sitting at a desk, opening specific software, following specific steps, waiting for specific results.

If the answer is yes? We're in a new one.

This morning:
- Voice prompt: "Build me an awards nomination site for BC AI. Clean, professional, form submission, database backend."
- 8 minutes later: Working prototype.
- 12 minutes of tweaking: Colors, fonts, layout, flow.
- 20 minutes total: Shipped.

From idea to deployed website. In the bathtub. Before 10am.

That's not normal. But it should be.

---

## "But Kris, That's Just a Template, Right?"

Wrong.

Templates start with someone else's vision. You bend your idea to fit their structure.

Vibe coding starts with your vision. The AI bends the structure to fit your idea.

Ariunzul came into Cohort 6 describing herself as "very beginner." Built an e-commerce site in 5 minutes. Not from a template. From a description of what she wanted.

Rob Rosenberg works at Paramount+. Built three production tools for their GOAT mascot campaign. Deployed globally. Used by the entire team.

In six weeks.

Because he could describe what the tools needed to do, and the AI could build the scaffolding.

His creative expertise—understanding what makes good branded content, what workflows actually need, what users will tolerate—that's what mattered.

The technical implementation? Handled.

## The Skills That Actually Matter Now

If you're a creative professional in 2025, here's what separates those crushing it from those struggling:

**What doesn't matter anymore:**
- Memorizing software shortcuts
- Hand-coding every pixel
- Waiting for developers to implement your vision
- Spending 80% of time on mechanical tasks

**What matters more than ever:**
- Taste (knowing what's good vs. garbage)
- Vision (articulating what you want)
- Iteration speed (trying ten ideas instead of one)
- Human judgment (AI outputs faux work product constantly)
- Original intelligence (you're the intelligence, AI is the amplifier)

Lizzie worried: "Will clients think I'm cutting corners if I use AI?"

Week 6, she built an interactive coverage recap website. Sentiment visualization. Filterable sections. Client self-service exploration.

Client response: **"Best coverage recap they'd ever received."**

Time invested: 6-7 hours.

Traditional alternative: Weeks. Thousands of dollars. A developer you have to brief, wait for, give feedback to, wait again.

She wasn't cutting corners. She was using a power tool to do work that previously required a whole construction crew.

## Digital Composting (Or: Nothing You've Learned is Wasted)

Here's what freaks people out: "Is everything I learned obsolete?"

No.

Everything you learned is substrate.

I spent 20 years learning photography, composition, color theory, visual storytelling, client management, project scoping.

None of that is wasted. All of that informs how I use AI.

The difference: Where I used to spend 80% of time on mechanical execution and 20% on creative decisions, it's flipped.

Now it's 80% creative decisions, 20% execution.

That's not a threat. That's the job we always wanted.

## Who This is For (And Who It's Not)

**This is for you if:**
- You're a creative professional who feels AI looming but don't know where to start
- You tried ChatGPT, got mediocre outputs, gave up
- You're worried you're falling behind but don't have time to "learn AI"
- You want to work faster without sacrificing quality
- You're curious but skeptical (good—skepticism is healthy)

**This is not for you if:**
- You think AI is going to do everything and you'll just supervise
- You're looking for a magic button that removes the need for taste
- You're not willing to iterate and experiment
- You want to "learn AI" in the abstract without building something real

AI doesn't replace creative professionals. It replaces the parts of creative work that suck.

The parts you got into this field to avoid? The repetitive, mechanical, soul-crushing busy work?

That's what dies.

The parts you got into this field to do? The creative, strategic, human-judgment-requiring work?

That's what grows.

## What You'll Actually Build (Not Just Learn)

AI Upgrade for Creative Professionals is six weeks.

Not six weeks of watching me demo tools.

Six weeks of you building something real.

**Week 1:** Course intro, AI landscape, ethics foundations. The stuff you need to know to not be dangerous.

**Week 2:** Text and prompt engineering. The POP Framework (Persona, Objective, Parameters). Build an AI assistant for your actual workflow.

**Week 3:** Image generation. The STAPLES Framework. Make things that don't look like every other AI image.

**Week 4:** Audio and voice. Transcription revolution. Grant support letters in 1/10th the time (ask Jeanette).

**Week 5:** Video and ethics. Deepfakes, responsibility, Sora, the works. Don't be the person who doesn't know this stuff.

**Week 6:** Capstone presentations. Show and tell extravaganza. You present the tool you built. We celebrate. You ship.

You get two one-on-one coaching sessions with me. One with Peter Bittner. Use them wisely—they book up fast.

You get a cohort of creative professionals going through the same transformation. Collaborations happen. Companies form. LinkedIn connections turn into client relationships.

You get frameworks that transfer to any AI platform. Because the tools will change. The principles won't.

## The Part Where I'm Honest About Fear

Every cohort starts the same way.

Someone asks: "What if clients think I'm cutting corners?"

Someone else: "What if I lose my creative identity?"

Another: "What if AI just makes everything look the same?"

These are real fears. I take them seriously.

Here's what I've watched happen, seven cohorts in:

**Week 1:** Fear and uncertainty. "Who are we if AI does our creative work?"

**Week 3:** Experimentation and discovery. "Oh, this is actually useful for [specific thing]."

**Week 6:** Deployed tools. Shipped projects. Transformed workflows.

Matthew Schwartzman joined Cohort 1 at 17. By the end, he'd founded the Surrey AI community. Regional ecosystem builder at 17.

Armin came in exploring AI. Left with TalentNow—a business with three paying clients by Week 6.

Udbhav went from "interested in AI" to 3rd place at the NASA Global Hackathon.

This isn't hype. This is what happens when creative professionals get systematic training, practical frameworks, and permission to experiment.

## Your Clients Are Already Using AI

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

Your clients fact-check your recommendations against ChatGPT.

They're not telling you. But they're doing it.

So you have two choices:

**Option A:** Ignore AI. Hope it goes away. Get fact-checked by clients who know more than you.

**Option B:** Learn how AI works. Its capabilities. Its limitations. Its proper role. Become the expert your clients need.

The PR professionals winning right now aren't hiding from AI. They aren't competing with AI. They're building with AI.

Same with designers. Same with photographers. Same with anyone doing creative knowledge work.

The future is here. It's just unevenly distributed.

Which side of that distribution do you want to be on?

## Questions?

Seriously. Reply to this post, DM me on LinkedIn, email me directly.

I read everything.

I've been teaching this for two years. I've seen the transformation arc dozens of times.

If you're on the fence, ask. If you're scared, say so. If you think I'm full of shit, challenge me.

The worst thing you can do is stay on the sidelines because you're unsure.

Uncertainty is fine. Paralysis is not.

## One More Thing

I vibe code up something almost every day.

It's only 9:40 today, and that's no exception.

The BCAI awards nomination website I built this morning in the bathtub? It's live. It works. People are using it.

That's not a flex. That's just what's possible now.

The question is: Are you going to learn how, or are you going to watch everyone else do it?

Your call.

See you in the cohort.

— Kris

**P.S.** If you know someone who needs this, forward them this post. Or just send them the discount code. It's good for two uses—you and one referral.

**P.P.S.** Still skeptical? Good. Come to a free office hours session. Watch me build something live. Ask hard questions. Then decide.
