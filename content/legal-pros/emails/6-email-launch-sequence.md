## EMAIL 1: THE BIG HELLO

**Send:** Week -1 (Early Bird Launch)
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Welcome to the AI Upgrade for Legal Professionals"
- "Model Rule 1.1 just got interesting"
- "Let's talk about the elephant in the legal room"

---

Hey there,

Kris Krug here. Founder of The Upgrade AI. Photographer. Technologist. Professional question-asker. And now: someone who helps legal professionals navigate the AI transformation.

I'm writing because you signed up to learn more about AI Upgrade for Legal Professionals. And I wanted to be the one to say hello.

Here's the deal:

You're probably wondering if AI is going to replace you. Or at least dramatically change what you do for a living. And honestly? **Both are true and neither is true.**

The legal professionals who thrive over the next decade won't be the ones fighting AI. They won't be the ones ignoring it. They'll be the ones **building with it.**

That's what we teach. Not how to use ChatGPT (you can figure that out on YouTube). We teach you how to think in frameworks, build custom assistants, and turn AI from a threat into a practice superpower.

Our next cohort kicks off soon. Over the next few days, I'm going to share:
- What we actually teach (spoiler: it's not tool tutorials)
- Why our approach starts with ethics and confidentiality
- Projected stories of what legal pros could build
- How to know if this is right for you

For now, I'll leave you with one question:

**What would you build if you knew you couldn't fail at the technical parts?**

A client intake system that actually understands your practice? A research assistant that knows your jurisdiction? A document generator that captures your analysis patterns?

Sit with that. I'll be back in a couple days.

— Kris

P.S. If you're already sold and just want the details, reply "READY" and I'll send you the full curriculum and application link.

## EMAIL 2: THE PROBLEM

**Send:** Launch Week Day 1
**Subject Line Options:**
- "The fear no one at your firm talks about"
- "It's not AI you're afraid of"
- "The real threat to legal careers (it's not what you think)"

---

Real talk.

I've taught hundreds of professionals how to work with AI. Not legal professionals yet—but I've seen the pattern across journalists, designers, PR professionals, creative workers of every kind.

And here's what I've learned:

**The fear isn't AI. The fear is obsolescence.**

It's the feeling that skills you spent years developing—legal research, document drafting, case analysis—might suddenly matter less. It's watching AI draft contracts in minutes that used to take hours. It's not knowing if you should embrace this stuff or resist it.

That fear is real. I'm not going to tell you it's irrational.

But here's what I WILL tell you:

The legal professionals who struggle aren't going to struggle because AI is too powerful.

They're going to struggle because they've decided they already know what AI can't do.

**Closed minds get left behind. Open minds get upgraded.**

The data backs this up. 75% of AI experts are optimistic about the technology. The more you know, the less you fear. That's not spin—that's the expert optimism effect.

And there's another reality you already know:

**Model Rule 1.1 now includes technological competence.**

Your bar association already expects you to understand how technology affects your practice. AI is technology. The ethical obligation isn't optional anymore.

The legal professionals winning right now aren't hiding from AI.
They're not competing with AI.
They're building with AI.

And they're doing it in ways that protect client confidentiality, maintain ethical boundaries, and amplify their original intelligence—not replace it.

Tomorrow I'll share what actually makes our approach different. (Hint: ethics comes on Day 1, not Day 6.)

— Kris

P.S. Still skeptical? Good. The skeptics often become our best students. They ask hard questions. They don't accept hype. And when they see it work? Their transformation is the most profound.

## EMAIL 3: HUMAN-CENTRIC APPROACH

**Send:** Launch Week Day 3
**Subject Line Options:**
- "AI won't replace lawyers. But..."
- "Why ethics comes first in our curriculum"
- "Why most AI courses get it backwards for legal professionals"

---

Let me cut through the noise.

Most AI courses teach tools. "Here's how to use ChatGPT. Here's how to prompt Claude. Here's the latest features in Gemini."

That's fine. But it's also free on YouTube.

Here's what we do differently for legal professionals:

**Ethics from Day 1.**

Not Day 6. Day 1.

Because you can't use AI effectively in legal practice without understanding:
- Client confidentiality boundaries (what never goes into AI)
- Your professional responsibility under Model Rule 1.1
- Bias in AI training data (and what that means for legal outcomes)
- The difference between AI augmentation and AI replacement

We don't teach you to blindly adopt AI. We teach you to adopt it responsibly.

**We teach frameworks, not tools.**

POP Framework. Agentic Spectrum. Knowledge Base Architecture. These work in ChatGPT. They work in Claude. They work in Gemini. They'll work in whatever comes next.

When the tools change (and they will), you won't have to start over. Because you learned to think, not just to click.

**We build real things.**

Not sandbox exercises. Not hypothetical projects. By Week 4, you have a working AI assistant for YOUR specific legal workflow. By Week 6, you present a capstone project that becomes a portfolio piece.

Imagine building:
- A research assistant that knows your jurisdiction's case law
- A client intake system for your practice area
- A document analysis tool that maintains confidentiality
- A matter management dashboard built from your templates

**We stay human.**

Here's the part most AI courses miss:

Your legal judgment is your moat. AI can learn research patterns. But it can't learn the 20 years of courtroom experience condensed into your intuition. The hard-won lessons from cases that went sideways. The values that drive ethical decisions AI can't replicate.

Your writing style is mimicable. Your worldview is not.

We teach you to build AI tools that amplify YOUR thinking. Not generic tools that could be anyone's. And we do it while protecting what matters most: client trust, ethical practice, and your professional judgment.

That's human-centric AI education for legal professionals.

Next email: I'll break down exactly what you learn in 6 weeks and what you walk away with.

— Kris

## EMAIL 5: WHAT THEY COULD BUILD

**Send:** Week 2
**Subject Line Options:**
- "What legal pros could build (projected outcomes)"
- "From skeptic to cyborg: aspirational stories"
- "The transformations that could happen"

---

I could keep telling you what we teach.

But let me show you what legal professionals COULD DO with it.

These are projected stories. We haven't run a Legal Pros cohort yet. But based on hundreds of students across other professional cohorts, here's what I know is possible:

---

**SARAH (Solo Practitioner, Family Law)**

Sarah could build a client intake assistant that:
- Gathers initial information through structured questions
- Identifies potential conflicts of interest
- Generates preliminary case assessment
- Creates matter folders with proper confidentiality

Time saved: 45+ minutes per new client.
Maintained: Complete confidentiality. No client data enters AI.

---

**MICHAEL (Corporate Counsel, Tech Company)**

Michael could build a contract analysis dashboard that:
- Compares contract clauses against company standards
- Flags unusual terms requiring human review
- Tracks key dates and obligations
- Generates executive summaries for non-legal stakeholders

Impact: Faster turnaround. Fewer missed details. More strategic focus.

---

**JENNIFER (Public Defender)**

Jennifer could build a case law research assistant that:
- Knows her jurisdiction's precedents
- Identifies relevant cases based on fact patterns
- Tracks recent decisions in her practice area
- Generates research memos as starting points for analysis

What changes: 3 hours of research → 30 minutes. More time for clients.

---

**DAVID (IP Attorney, Patents)**

David could build a prior art research system that:
- Searches across patent databases
- Identifies potential conflicts
- Generates comparison reports
- Tracks filing deadlines across jurisdictions

The advantage: Thoroughness at scale. Nothing missed.

---

**ELENA (Associate, Big Law)**

Elena could build a document review assistant that:
- Analyzes discovery documents for key terms
- Flags potential privilege issues
- Generates review summaries
- Maintains chain of custody documentation

Career impact: Higher quality work. Faster turnaround. Partner-level reliability.

---

**JAMES (Immigration Attorney)**

James could build a forms preparation system that:
- Guides clients through information gathering
- Checks for completeness before submission
- Tracks case status across multiple matters
- Generates status update emails

Client experience: Dramatically improved. Fewer errors. Faster processing.

---

These aren't guarantees. They're projections based on what we've seen creative professionals, journalists, and other knowledge workers build in our existing cohorts.

The pattern is always the same:
- Week 1: "Can AI really help my legal practice?"
- Week 6: "Why didn't I learn this sooner?"

The gap between those moments isn't about AI getting better.
It's about YOU getting better at using it.

What would YOUR transformation story be?

## EMAIL 6: LAST CALL

**Send:** Week 3 (Close)
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Final call: doors close [DATE]"
- "This is the last email"
- "The gap between who you are and who you could be"

---

This is my last email about this cohort.

Not because I'm giving up on you. Because enrollment closes in [X hours] and I want to be straight with you.

**Six weeks from now, you'll be somewhere.**

Option A: You'll be building custom AI assistants for your practice. Creating research tools that know your jurisdiction. Using frameworks that work across any platform. Part of a community of legal professionals who get it. And doing it all within ethical boundaries that protect client confidentiality.

Option B: You'll be exactly where you are now. Same anxiety. Same uncertainty. Same FOMO watching other lawyers adapt faster.

The gap between those futures is one decision.

**I know the objections:**

"I don't have time."
You don't have 90 minutes a week? The course SAVES time. Students across other professions report 5+ hours saved per week after applying what they learn. Imagine cutting legal research from 3 hours to 30 minutes.

"What about client confidentiality?"
That's EXACTLY why we teach this. You'll learn what never goes into AI, how to build tools that maintain privilege, and how to use AI responsibly. The lawyers who DON'T learn this? They're the confidentiality risk.

"It's too expensive."
It's priced less than 5 billable hours. And the ROI? If you save even 2 hours per week, you're ahead in month one. Some students have built tools that became practice differentiators.

"I'll learn it on my own."
Maybe. Or maybe you'll keep saying that for another year while other lawyers build competitive advantages. The course provides structure, coaching, accountability, and community. That's why it works.

"I'm not technical enough."
Neither were 90% of our students across all cohorts. We don't teach coding. We teach frameworks anyone can use. If you can write a legal memo, you can write a system prompt.

"My firm doesn't allow AI."
Your firm expects Model Rule 1.1 compliance: technological competence. Understanding AI IS the competence requirement now. This course teaches you to evaluate, adopt, and use AI responsibly—exactly what Rule 1.1 requires.

---

**Here's what I know:**

The legal professionals winning right now aren't hiding from AI.
They're not competing with AI.
They're building with AI.

I've created a place where you can learn to do that. With real guidance. With real community. With real outcomes. And with ethics from Day 1.

The door closes on [DATE] at [TIME].

**[SECURE YOUR SPOT]**

If this isn't right for you, I respect that. Unsubscribe and no hard feelings.

But if you've been waiting for a sign, consider this it.

The upgrade awaits.
