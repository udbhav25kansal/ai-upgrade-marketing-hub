# AI Upgrade for Healthcare Professionals: 6-Email Launch Sequence
## Complete Nurture Funnel from Awareness to Enrollment

---

## SEQUENCE OVERVIEW

**Purpose:** Convert leads from playbook download to program enrollment
**Timing:** 14 days from download to final CTA
**Tone:** Clinician-to-clinician, patient-first, safety-focused
**Goal:** 3-5% conversion to enrollment

**Aspirational Content Notice:** These emails represent projected messaging for healthcare professionals who might participate in future AI Upgrade programs. Stories and transformations described are aspirational examples, not documented case studies.

---

## EMAIL 1: THE BIG HELLO

**Send:** Immediately upon playbook download

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Your Healthcare AI Playbook is ready"
- "Here's your playbook (plus what nobody tells you about AI in clinical settings)"
- "The playbook is attached—start with the safety protocols"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Your playbook is attached.

If you only have 10 minutes, start with Part 1: The Clinical AI Safety Framework. That's where we address the questions keeping you up at night—HIPAA, patient safety, diagnostic accuracy, liability.

But here's what the playbook doesn't cover:

**The real question isn't whether AI can help clinicians.**

Mayo. Cleveland Clinic. Kaiser. Johns Hopkins—they've all integrated AI into clinical workflows.

Radiology. Pathology. Clinical documentation. Prior authorization. These aren't experiments anymore. They're production systems.

The real question is whether you'll stumble through implementation alone, make preventable mistakes, or learn from people who've already figured out how to do this safely.

That's what we do at The Upgrade. We take healthcare professionals from wherever they are with AI to building patient-safe workflows in 6 weeks.

Not vendor demos. Not innovation theater. Actual tools you'll use in your practice.

More on that in the next few emails. For now, dig into the playbook.

And hit reply if you have questions—**Dean Shev** (who built AI systems for Vancouver Health Tech) and I read every response.

Kris

P.S. — Page 9 has the Prior Authorization Accelerator workflow. If you've ever spent 45 minutes on hold with an insurance company, that one alone is worth the download.

## EMAIL 2: THE PROBLEM

**Send:** Day 2

**Subject Line Options:**
- "The clinical burnout crisis nobody's solving"
- "Why your EHR is killing you (and what AI can actually do about it)"
- "Documentation burden, prior auth hell, and 32% of you considering quitting"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Let me tell you what I'm hearing from clinicians.

**Documentation is eating your practice alive.**

The average physician spends 16 minutes per patient encounter on documentation. That's 2 hours of charting for every 1 hour of patient care.

You went to medical school to heal people, not to be a medical transcriptionist.

**Prior authorization is clinical abuse.**

45 minutes per complex case. Peer-to-peer reviews that aren't with peers. Denials for evidence-based treatments. Insurance clerks overruling your clinical judgment.

32% of physicians under 40 are considering leaving clinical practice. Not because they stopped caring about patients. Because the system makes caring impossible.

**And here's the thing AI vendors won't tell you:**

Generic AI tools don't work in healthcare. ChatGPT doesn't understand HIPAA. Claude doesn't know HL7 standards. Perplexity can't integrate with EPIC.

You need AI that understands healthcare specifically. Built by people who understand clinical workflows. Deployed with patient safety as the first principle, not an afterthought.

That's what **Dean Shev** brings from Vancouver Health Tech. That's what we're building at The Upgrade.

Tomorrow, I'll share what's actually possible when AI is implemented correctly.

Talk soon,

Kris

## EMAIL 3: THE HUMAN-CENTRIC APPROACH

**Send:** Day 4

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Patient safety first. Then speed."
- "Why we say 'human-in-the-loop' 47 times per week"
- "This is what responsible clinical AI looks like"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Every AI conversation in healthcare should start with one sentence:

**The human is never out of the loop.**

Here's our philosophy, learned from **Dean Shev's** work at VHT.ai and clinical implementations across BC:

**Principle 1: AI suggests. Humans decide.**
No autonomous diagnosis. No automated prescribing. AI provides decision support. Your clinical judgment remains primary.

**Principle 2: Patient safety beats efficiency.**
If a workflow saves time but introduces risk, we don't build it. Zero shortcuts on safety.

**Principle 3: HIPAA isn't negotiable.**
Local models where possible. Encrypted transmission always. BAA-compliant tools only. Your patient data stays protected.

**Principle 4: Algorithmic humility.**
AI makes mistakes. We design workflows that catch them. Double-check mechanisms. Verification steps. Human oversight at critical points.

**Principle 5: Original intelligence amplification.**
You're the clinician. You're the original intelligence. AI amplifies your expertise. It doesn't replace it.

This isn't the kind of AI implementation where vendors promise magic and hope you don't notice the risks.

This is the kind where we acknowledge every limitation, design for every failure mode, and put patient safety first.

That's what makes it worth learning.

Next email: What you'd actually build in the program.

Kris

P.S. — **Dean Shev** worked on AI systems that process 100,000+ patient interactions. He's seen every way AI can fail in healthcare. That's why we teach defensive implementation.

## EMAIL 4: YOUR AI JOURNEY

**Send:** Day 7

**Subject Line Options:**
- "What actually happens in 6 weeks"
- "The clinical AI curriculum (unfiltered)"
- "Here's exactly what you'd build"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

You asked (or you're wondering): What actually happens in the AI Upgrade for Healthcare Professionals?

Here's the honest breakdown, with contributions from **Kris Krüg**, **Peter Bittner** (machine learning engineer), and **Dean Shev** (VHT.ai healthcare AI systems):

**Week 1: Clinical Documentation Liberation**
You'll build an AI scribe that understands your specialty's terminology. Patient encounters get documented in your voice, in your format, ready for you to review and finalize. What used to take 16 minutes takes 4.

**Week 2: Prior Authorization Acceleration**
You'll create a workflow that drafts prior auth requests, pulls supporting research, and generates peer-to-peer talking points. That 45-minute insurance fight becomes a 10-minute review.

**Week 3: Diagnostic Decision Support**
You'll build a second brain that knows current literature, differential diagnosis frameworks, and red flags for your specialty. Not making diagnoses—supporting yours.

**Week 4: Patient Communication Systems**
You'll create AI-powered patient education materials at appropriate health literacy levels. Discharge instructions. Treatment explanations. Follow-up protocols. All in plain language.

**Week 5: Clinical Workflow Optimization**
You'll analyze where your time actually goes and build AI workflows that eliminate non-clinical busy work. Scheduling. Prescription refills. Result follow-ups. The stuff that doesn't require an MD.

**Week 6: Capstone Project**
You'll ship a production tool that solves your biggest clinical pain point. Something you'll actually use Monday morning.

Class size is small (12-15 clinicians). Mix of specialties. You learn from each other's workflows.

Next email: Who this is actually for (and who it's not for).

## EMAIL 5: WHAT THEY COULD BUILD

**Send:** Day 10

**Subject Line Options:**
- "What clinicians are building with AI (aspirational scenarios)"
- "The future of your practice looks like this"
- "Clinical transformation examples—where healthcare AI is headed"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Let me paint a picture of what clinicians could build with systematic AI training.

These are aspirational scenarios—examples of where healthcare AI is headed, not documented case studies:

**Dr. Sarah — Emergency Medicine**
Could build an AI triage assistant that pulls relevant medical history, flags drug interactions, and generates documentation templates—while she focuses on actual patient care instead of computer screens.

**James — ICU Nurse**
Could create a monitoring dashboard that synthesizes vitals, lab trends, and early warning scores—giving him pattern recognition across 6 patients simultaneously that would be impossible manually.

**Dr. Maria — Hospitalist**
Could develop a discharge planning workflow that coordinates six departments, generates patient instructions at 5th-grade reading level, and schedules follow-ups—turning a 90-minute process into 20 minutes.

**Chris — Clinical Pharmacist**
Could build a medication reconciliation system that catches interactions, suggests therapeutic alternatives, and generates insurance appeals—doing in 10 minutes what currently takes an hour.

**Emily — Physician Assistant**
Could create specialty-specific clinical decision trees that synthesize evidence, flag guideline updates, and suggest diagnostic pathways—making her as effective as physicians with 10 more years of experience.

**Dr. Alex — Family Medicine**
Could develop a chronic disease management dashboard tracking A1Cs, blood pressures, and care gaps across 2,000 patients—making population health actually manageable in a small practice.

**Dr. Jennifer — Oncology**
Could build a clinical trial matching system that identifies eligible patients, summarizes inclusion criteria, and drafts enrollment discussions—finding opportunities that would otherwise be missed.

**David — Quality Analyst**
Could create a mortality review assistant that identifies patterns across cases, suggests investigation pathways, and tracks interventions—making M&M conferences actually lead to system improvement.

**Rachel — Healthcare Administrator**
Could develop a staffing optimization model that predicts census, identifies burnout risk, and suggests schedule adjustments—before clinicians hit breaking points.

**Dr. Kevin — Medical Director**
Could build a quality metrics dashboard synthesizing HEDIS measures, readmission rates, and patient satisfaction—giving him real-time visibility instead of quarterly lag.

This isn't science fiction. This is where systematic clinical AI training leads.

The question is whether you'll build it—or watch others build it first.

One more email coming with enrollment details.

Kris

P.S. — Notice what all these scenarios have in common? The clinician is still central. AI handles everything else.

## EMAIL 6: LAST CALL

**Send:** Day 14

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Applications open for Healthcare AI Cohort [X]"
- "The next 6 weeks could transform your practice"
- "Your invitation to join us (if you're ready)"

---

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Applications are open for our next cohort of AI Upgrade for Healthcare Professionals.

Here's what you need to know:

**The Honest Assessment:**

This program is for you if:
- You're a practicing clinician, nurse, pharmacist, or clinical admin
- You're drowning in documentation and prior auth hell
- You're willing to invest 3-4 hours per week for 6 weeks
- You want to build real tools that improve patient care
- You believe AI should augment clinicians, not replace them

This program probably isn't for you if:
- You're happy with your current workflow
- You think AI has no place in clinical practice
- You can't commit the time right now
- You're looking for autonomous diagnostic systems (we don't build those)
- You want vendor magic without understanding how it works

**Program Details:**

**Dates:** [START DATE] to [END DATE]
**Format:** Live sessions + hands-on building + clinician cohort community
**Time commitment:** 3-4 hours per week
**Class size:** 12-15 healthcare professionals

**Instructors:**
- **Kris Krüg** — AI Upgrade methodology, second brain systems
- **Peter Bittner** — Machine learning engineering, model deployment
- **Dean Shev** — Clinical AI workflows, VHT.ai healthcare systems expertise

**What you'll build:**
- Clinical documentation assistant for your specialty
- Prior authorization acceleration workflow
- Diagnostic decision support second brain
- Patient education content generator
- Custom workflow optimizer for your biggest pain point

**Investment:** [PRICE]
(Payment plans available. CME credit under review.)

**The application takes 5 minutes.** We ask about your clinical role, your biggest workflow pain points, and what you hope to build.

Not everyone who applies is accepted. We're looking for clinicians who will engage fully, contribute to the cohort, and build with patient safety as the first principle.

**Apply here: [LINK]**

Applications close [DATE].

If you have questions about HIPAA compliance, liability, or clinical implementation, just reply. Dean and I answer every email.

Thanks for reading these emails. Whatever you decide, I hope the playbook helps reduce your documentation burden.

Kris

P.S. — The biggest objection we hear: "I don't have time to learn AI tools."

Here's the truth: You don't have time NOT to.

That 2 hours of daily documentation? That 45 minutes of prior auth hell? That's 15 hours per week you could get back.

6 weeks of investment. 15 hours per week returned. That's the math.
