## CATEGORY 1: THE 80% INVISIBLE BUYING CYCLE (Posts 1-10)

### Post 1: The AI Research Reality
Your prospects are researching you in ChatGPT.

Not "might be." Are. Right now.

They're typing your company name into AI, getting a synthesis of your entire web presence, and preparing questions to ask you before you even know they exist.

80% of the buying cycle happens before first contact.

The question isn't whether this is happening.

The question is: What does ChatGPT say about you?

If you're not producing AI-discoverable content, you don't exist in that 80% phase.

### Post 2: Six Figures From AI Search
"We found you through ChatGPT."

That's what prospects are telling Shane Gibson. Over six figures of opportunities this year from AI-based search and chat.

Not theoretical. Not someday. This year.

Here's what's changed:

Your website SEO matters less.
Your omnichannel content presence matters more.

AI determines expertise by volume of quality mentions across the entire internet. Not just your domain.

The salespeople dominating now aren't better at cold calling.

They're better at being found.

---

### Post 3: The 25-Channel Reality
Ten years ago, B2B buyers were on 6-10 channels.

Today? 25+ channels daily.

LinkedIn. Instagram. TikTok. ChatGPT. Perplexity. Podcasts. YouTube. Slack. Email. Conferences. Peer networks.

You can't manually create content for all of them.

But you can create once and atomize everywhere.

One 30-minute video → 53 pieces of content.

That's not a fantasy. That's a content waterfall system.

Your buyers are fragmented. Your content strategy needs to match.

---

### Post 4: The 11 Stakeholders
Your average B2B buying group: 11 stakeholders.

Eleven people influencing whether they do business with you.

You're not selling to one person. You're selling to a committee.

Some care about price. Some about risk. Some about implementation. Some about looking smart to their boss.

Here's what that means for your content:

You need multiple angles on the same topic.
You need different depths for different roles.
You need to be everywhere they research.

Content isn't marketing anymore. Content is selling at scale.

---

### Post 5: The Pre-Prepared Prospect
Your prospect researched you in ChatGPT.
ChatGPT prepared a document of questions to ask you.
They compared you to competitors.
They identified your weaknesses.

THEN they reached out.

That's the modern buying cycle.

By the time they contact you, they've made 80% of their decision.

You're not starting from scratch. You're defending ground you may have already lost.

Unless your content shaped that research phase.

---

### Post 6: The Rep-Free Regret
75% of B2B buyers say they prefer a rep-free sales experience.

But almost a third regret that purchase.

They wanted self-service. They got confusion.

Here's the opportunity:

Content that educates before the conversation.
Humans who guide when it matters.

Hybrid selling. Not either/or.

Let your content do the heavy lifting. Show up when strategic guidance actually helps.

That's the model that wins.

---

### Post 7: The Consistency Multiplier
Buyers are 2.8x more likely to complete a purchase when messaging is consistent across all touchpoints.

Website. Sales rep. LinkedIn. Marketing materials.

If your LinkedIn voice doesn't match your website, buyers sense it.

If your sales pitch contradicts your content, trust erodes.

Here's the fix:

One source of truth. Your worldview guide.
AI generates everything from that foundation.
Consistency without micromanagement.

Coherence closes deals.

---

### Post 8: The 95% Not Ready
Only 5% of B2B buyers are actively shopping right now.

That means 95% of your ICP is not ready to buy today.

But they will be. In 6 months. In 18 months.

The question is: When they enter buying mode, who's top of mind?

Cold calling catches 5%.
Content presence captures the other 95% when they're ready.

Long game wins.

---

### Post 9: The AI Summary Problem
When your prospect asks ChatGPT about your company, what does it say?

If you haven't published enough:
"Limited information available about this company."

If you've been content waterfall-ing:
Detailed summary of your expertise, methodology, client results.

The AI summary is the new first impression.

What's yours saying?

---

### Post 10: The Decision Override
58% of B2B buyers report their decisions were overridden by senior executives.

You sold the director. The VP said no.

Content strategy implication:

Even if you're selling to mid-level, you need C-suite content.

The final decision maker may not be your day-to-day contact.

Are you producing thought leadership that lands at executive level?

---

## CATEGORY 2: CONTENT MULTIPLICATION (Posts 11-20)

### Post 11: The 53-Piece Math
One 30-minute video.
53 pieces of content.

Here's the breakdown:
- 14 short clips (30-130 seconds)
- 11 chapter clips (2-5 minutes)
- 2 blog posts (different sites, different wording)
- 4 LinkedIn posts (different angles)
- 2 carousels (12 slides each)
- Short-form video scripts
- Image prompts for each piece

Your competitors are crafting one blog post.
You're shipping 53 pieces.

That's not working harder. That's working different.

---

### Post 12: The Rant-to-Post Pipeline
Here's my content system:

1. Great client call ends
2. Pick up phone, record 2-minute voice memo (totally unedited)
3. Transcribe automatically
4. Feed to ChatGPT: "Write 180-word LinkedIn post, keep my tone, fix grammar"
5. Review and ship

Total time: 10 minutes.

Your best insights happen in conversation. Capture them before they disappear.

---

### Post 13: The Curate Don't Create Hack
You don't have to create every piece of content.

Find a valuable industry report. Upload it to ChatGPT.

"Summarize key stats in 300-word LinkedIn post in my tone."

Ship it. Link to original.

You look like a thought leader (sharing valuable third-party content).
You're not pitching (pure value-add).
It took 4 minutes.

Curate, don't just create.

---

### Post 14: The Billboard Effect
If you post on LinkedIn daily, here's what happens:

Every time someone logs in, they see your face.

They might not read it. Doesn't matter.

You've bought a billboard across from their house.

Familiarity builds trust. Trust builds deals.

11 posts per month is the algorithm sweet spot.
That's every other business day.
With AI, that's 15 minutes of effort.

Presence beats perfection.

---

### Post 15: The Waterfall Assistant
I built a custom GPT called a Content Waterfall Assistant.

It has:
- My writing style guide (how I write)
- My worldview guide (how I think)
- My signature frameworks (my IP)
- Sample transcripts (my voice)

When I feed it a transcript, it outputs:
- 2 blog posts
- 4 LinkedIn posts
- 2 carousels
- Short-form scripts
- Image prompts

Build once. Multiply forever.

---

### Post 16: The One-Liner Power
Sometimes I just type:

"Write me something on trust in sales."

My content waterfall assistant pulls from everything I've ever written.

It knows my frameworks. My stories. My perspective.

Fresh blog post. My voice. 30 seconds.

That's what a properly-trained knowledge base does.

---

### Post 17: The Duplicate Content Solution
Here's a trick for content multiplication:

When generating blog posts for multiple sites, tell AI to write the same topic with different wording.

Same insights. Different structure and phrasing.

Google's duplicate content penalty doesn't flag it.
You get to own multiple first-page results.

Atomize intelligently.

---

### Post 18: The 80% Front Page
Shane Gibson searched "keynote speaker on AI for sales."

His results on Google's first page:
- His website
- His videos (3 results)
- His second website
- His X profile
- His blog post

80% of the front page.

Not from traditional SEO. From content atomization across 25+ channels.

Volume of quality mentions = AI expertise ranking.

---

### Post 19: The Team LinkedIn Problem
Sales managers, raise your hand if your team doesn't post enough on LinkedIn.

They don't know what to post.
They don't know what NOT to post.
They're afraid of saying the wrong thing.

Solution: Team LinkedIn Custom GPT.

Upload: Guardrails, good examples, brand voice, ICP docs.

Rep uploads call transcript → GPT extracts LinkedIn-worthy insight → Posted in company voice.

Autonomy with guardrails.

---

### Post 20: The Carousel Generator
Want a LinkedIn carousel in 5 minutes?

1. Have a rant (voice memo or text)
2. ChatGPT writes LinkedIn post
3. "Turn this into text for a 12-slide LinkedIn carousel"
4. Drop into Canva template
5. Export as PDF
6. Post

One rant → one post → one carousel → one video → one blog

The multiplication is infinite.

---

## CATEGORY 3: TIME SAVINGS (Posts 21-30)

### Post 21: The Research Revolution
Traditional prospect research:
- Google company
- Read About page
- Check LinkedIn
- Wing it

Time: 30+ minutes

AI-augmented research:
- Input company name to Perplexity
- AI analyzes funding, team, tech stack, pain points, news
- Outputs tailored discovery questions

Time: 3 minutes.

Same call. Ten times faster prep.

---

### Post 22: The Proposal Compression
Traditional proposal writing:
1. Find template (10 min)
2. Search for case studies (20 min)
3. Customize value prop (30 min)
4. Update pricing (10 min)
5. Proofread (15 min)

Total: 85 minutes.

AI-augmented:
1. Input discovery call transcript
2. AI extracts pain points, selects case studies, writes proposal
3. Human reviews (10 min)

Total: 15 minutes.

Stop spending your day writing proposals.

---

### Post 23: The Follow-Up Factory
Shane's 7-touch follow-up sequence:

Day 0: Post-call thank you + recap
Day 2: Relevant article (value-add, no ask)
Day 7: Proposal delivery
Day 10: Check-in question (not "following up")
Day 17: Case study share
Day 24: "Closing the loop" email
Day 30+: Monthly nurture

All 7 emails drafted by AI from discovery call transcript.
Personalization tokens included.
Calendar reminders set automatically.

---

### Post 24: The Silence Analyzer
Prospect went dark after proposal?

Feed the discovery call transcript to AI:

"I sent this proposal 10 days ago. Why might they not be responding? What are the likely blockers?"

AI analysis:
- Budget approval cycle (they mentioned Q4 freeze)
- Multiple stakeholders (CFO not yet involved)
- Competing priorities (merger mentioned)

Recommended action: Don't chase. Send value-add on post-merger integration.

AI helps diagnose silence, not just automate outreach.

---

### Post 25: The Two-AI Quality Check
Here's how to make AI output better:

Use ChatGPT for initial draft.
Use Claude for review and improvement.
Merge the best elements.

Two AIs fighting makes better output than one AI alone.

Different training data = different blind spots.

Quality through competition.

---

### Post 26: The Instant Sales Coach
After every discovery call:

1. Feed transcript to Sales Coach GPT
2. Get immediate analysis:
   - Questions you missed
   - Objection handling opportunities
   - Next step clarity
   - Talk ratio (ideal: prospect talks 70%)

Don't wait for your weekly 1-on-1.
Get coaching after every call.

Iteration speed: daily instead of weekly.

---

### Post 27: The Template Multiplier
First AI-assisted proposal: 60 minutes.
Second: 30 minutes.
Third: 15 minutes.
Tenth: Almost nothing (template reuse).

The efficiency compounds.

Build the knowledge base once. Deploy across your entire pipeline.

What was impossible to scale is now trivial.

---

### Post 28: The ICP Scorer
Perplexity lead scoring demo:

Input: Company name
AI analyzes: Funding, team size, tech stack, pain indicators, recent news
Output: A/B/C classification + tailored discovery questions

3 minutes vs. 30 minutes.
Better quality.
No guesswork.

---

### Post 29: The Tone Matcher
Student discovered her proposals had a tone mismatch.

Company voice: Aspirational, purpose-driven, sustainability-focused.
ICP voice: Tactical, operational, "how does this work?"

AI proposal analysis revealed the gap.

Fix: Not abandoning ethos. Adding tactical outcomes alongside purpose messaging.

AI diagnostics catch what humans miss.

---

### Post 30: The Pre-Call Cheat Sheet
Before every meeting, my AI generates:

- Company overview (funding, news, pain indicators)
- Key stakeholders and their likely priorities
- 5 tailored discovery questions
- Potential objections and handling strategies
- Competitor positioning

Takes 3 minutes.
Walk in overprepared every time.

---

## CATEGORY 4: BUILDER MINDSET (Posts 31-40)

### Post 31: The Builder Transformation
Six weeks ago: "I use ChatGPT to help write emails."

Today: "I built 3 custom GPTs for my sales workflow."

The shift isn't in what tools you use.
It's whether you're a user or a builder.

Tool users depend on defaults.
Tool builders shape their own systems.

Which are you becoming?

---

### Post 32: The Non-Architect Architect
I'm not a software architect.

But I built an automation tool that processes transcripts, applies custom prompts, generates images, and drops everything into Notion.

How? Back and forth with ChatGPT:

"Write me Python code that does X."
Debug it. Document it. Stick it on GitHub.

You don't need to be technical. You need to be persistent.

---

### Post 33: The Afternoon Rebuild
Everything I built over the past year?

"If I was you starting today, I could rebuild it in an afternoon inside N8N or Make or Zapier."

The tools have gotten that good.

No Python required. No APIs at first.
Just chain: Audio → Transcribe → ChatGPT → Output → Notion.

What took months now takes hours.

---

### Post 34: The MVP Mindset
Student wanted to build a complex 1,000-hour video support system.

My coaching:

"Have you built a simple GPT that helps YOU first? One that tells you the top 20 themes in those thousand hours?"

Build personal tool → Use it yourself → THEN decide if you need the fancy system.

Don't skip steps.

---

### Post 35: The Knowledge Base Differentiator
Here's what separates toy demos from production tools:

The quality of your knowledge base.

Same prompts.
Same AI model.
Dramatically different outputs.

Your knowledge base contains:
- Case studies (real, not invented)
- Pricing (accurate, current)
- Voice guide (your actual tone)
- Worldview (your actual perspective)

Garbage in, garbage out.
Quality in, production-ready out.

---

### Post 36: The Two-Document Foundation
When building AI assistants, I use two core documents:

1. Writing Style Guide
How I write: sentence length, word choice, structure, formatting.

2. Worldview Guide
How I think: values, beliefs, principles, decision-making framework.

How I write + How I think = outputs that sound like me.

This is what makes AI assistants authentic.

---

### Post 37: The Worldview Moat
Technical skills commoditize fast.

Everyone can learn prompting.
Everyone has access to same tools.
Everyone can use ChatGPT.

What remains differentiating:
- Your worldview (unique perspective, hard-won insights)
- Your domain expertise (20 years in your industry)
- Your relationship quality (trust is still human)

AI can mimic voice.
AI cannot invent your hard-won lessons.

That's your moat.

---

### Post 38: The Discovery Interview Method
How to build a knowledge base for industrial B2B:

1. Create GPT that asks what it needs to know
2. Interview your internal SMEs (engineers, product team)
3. Feed answers back into knowledge base
4. AI now writes with real expertise

Patrick used this for LinkedIn content.
His marketing GPT now produces 4-week content plans.

The expertise already exists in your company. Extract it.

---

### Post 39: The Founder Moment
You know that feeling?

You're in the car. Or lying in bed. An idea hits.

"I need to remember this."
"I need to act on this."

But you can't write it down. So it disappears.

Bruce built a voice-activated system for exactly this.
Record the idea. AI processes it. Calendar and tasks updated.

Capture everything. Lose nothing.

---

### Post 40: The Production Threshold
Here's when you know your AI tool is production-ready:

It's already in use.
It's already solving problems.
People would miss it if it was gone.

Matt's sales-to-onboarding GPT? Already live, eliminating disputes.
Patrick's LinkedIn manager? Getting positive trade show feedback.

Not someday. Today.

---

## CATEGORY 5: CALL TO ACTION (Posts 41-50)

### Post 41: The 6-Week Transformation
Week 1: "Can AI really help me sell more?"
Week 6: "Here's my complete AI-augmented sales system."

That's the arc we see every cohort.

Not because AI got smarter.
Because you got better at using it.

Next cohort starts soon.

---

### Post 42: The Systems Builder Path
There are two kinds of salespeople in 2025:

1. Those who use AI tools (one-off prompts, occasional help)
2. Those who build AI systems (proposal writers, content waterfalls, CRM integrations)

One saves some time.
One fundamentally changes how you work.

We teach the second path.

---

### Post 43: The Content Domination Strategy
What if you could ship 53 pieces of content a month?

While your competitors craft 2 blog posts?

That's not about working more hours.
That's about understanding content multiplication.

One video → 53 pieces → 25+ channels → AI search dominance.

We teach the system.

---

### Post 44: The Inbound Future
What if prospects found you in ChatGPT before they ever reached out?

What if they arrived already understanding your methodology?

What if cold calling became optional?

This isn't fantasy. Shane's generating six figures from AI search inbound.

The playbook exists.

---

### Post 45: The Team Enablement
Your sales team should be posting on LinkedIn.
They're not.

Not because they're lazy.
Because they don't know what's allowed.

Team LinkedIn GPT: Guardrails + examples + brand voice.
Every rep posts with confidence.

We build this in Week 4.

---

### Post 46: The Proposal Factory
What if proposals took 15 minutes instead of 85?

What if they were more personalized, not less?

What if the AI selected the right case studies automatically?

That's the Proposal Writer Architecture:
Knowledge base + System prompt + Quality gates.

We build this in Week 3.

---

### Post 47: The Research Accelerator
3 minutes to know everything about a prospect:

- Funding history
- Team composition
- Tech stack
- Recent news
- Pain indicators
- Tailored questions

That's AI-augmented discovery prep.
Every call starts from advantage.

---

### Post 48: The Capstone Proof
Our graduates don't just learn frameworks.

They ship production tools:
- Investor scoring systems (Dev)
- Voice-activated scheduling (Bruce)
- Sales-to-onboarding handovers (Matt)
- Go-to-market strategies loved by CEOs (Monica)

Learning through building. That's the model.

---

### Post 49: The Expert Optimism Path
75% of AI experts are optimistic about their future.

The more you know, the less you fear.

We take you from wherever you are to expert-level AI fluency.

Not in theory. In practice.
Building tools that work.

---

### Post 50: The Decision Point
Six weeks from now, you'll be somewhere.

Either building AI-augmented sales systems that multiply your output.

Or exactly where you are now.

The gap between those futures is one decision.

Next cohort starts [DATE].

---

## POST FORMATTING NOTES

### Hook Patterns That Work
- Direct statement (no preamble)
- Surprising statistic
- Relatable frustration
- Future scenario

### Length Guidelines
- Sweet spot: 150-200 words
- Maximum: 250 words
- Under 100 feels thin
- Over 300 loses attention

### Hashtag Strategy
- 2-3 maximum or none
- Avoid generic (#sales, #AI)
- Prefer specific (#AIinSales, #B2BSales, #SalesLeadership)

### Image Pairing
- Text posts work fine alone
- Carousels drive high engagement
- Screenshots of tools add credibility
- AI-generated images: screen capture to remove metadata
