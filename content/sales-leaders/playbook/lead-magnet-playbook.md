# The Sales Leader's Guide to AI
## 5 Systems That Actually Close Deals (From Someone Who's Trained 200+ Sales Professionals)

**By Kris Krug, Founder of The Upgrade AI**

## A Note Before We Begin

Let's cut through the noise.

You've heard the AI hype. "10x productivity." "Replace your SDRs." "Never cold call again."

Most of it is garbage.

Here's the reality I've seen training sales professionals across industries—from space education in South Africa to petroleum software in North America to industrial compression systems that grew from $1M to $20M in a single year:

**AI doesn't close deals. Salespeople close deals. AI multiplies what great salespeople can do.**

The difference between sales pros who are thriving with AI and those who are struggling? The thrivers aren't just using ChatGPT for emails. They're building systems.

Systems for research. Systems for proposals. Systems for content. Systems for follow-up. Systems that compound over time.

This playbook gives you five of those systems. Not prompts to copy-paste (those never work as well as the original context). Frameworks that transfer to any tool, any platform, any model.

Let's go.

## System 1: The 3-Minute Prospect Research Stack

### The Problem

Traditional prospect research:
1. Google the company
2. Read the About page
3. Check LinkedIn
4. Wing it

Time: 30+ minutes. Quality: Variable. Consistency: None.

### The AI-Augmented Approach

**Step 1: The Perplexity Deep Dive**

Input the company name into Perplexity with this framework:

"Give me a comprehensive overview of [Company Name] including:
- Recent funding or financial news
- Key executives and their backgrounds
- Technology stack or product offerings
- Recent news mentions or press releases
- Likely pain points for a [your industry] solution
- Competitive positioning

Cite your sources."

**Time: 2 minutes. Output: Comprehensive, cited research.**

**Step 2: The ICP Scoring**

Create a simple scoring system:

| Criteria | Weight | Score (1-10) |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Industry fit | 20% | |
| Company size | 20% | |
| Tech stack alignment | 15% | |
| Pain point indicators | 20% | |
| Timing signals | 15% | |
| Budget authority indicators | 10% | |

Feed your Perplexity research to ChatGPT:

"Based on this research, score this company against my ICP criteria: [paste criteria]. Classify as A (ideal), B (good fit), or C (marginal)."

**Step 3: The Tailored Question Generator**

"Based on this research and ICP score, generate 5 discovery questions that:
- Address their likely pain points
- Reference recent news or changes
- Position me as informed and prepared
- Open opportunities for my solution"

### The 80% Problem This Solves

80% of the buying cycle happens before first contact. Your prospects have already researched you in ChatGPT. They've prepared questions. They've compared you to competitors.

With this system, you're equally prepared. Every call starts from advantage.

### Real-World Validation

Shane Gibson, one of our instructors: "3 minutes vs. 30 minutes. That's what AI-powered prospect research looks like."

## System 2: The Proposal Writer Architecture

### The Problem

Traditional proposal writing:
1. Find template (10 minutes searching)
2. Search for relevant case studies (20 minutes)
3. Customize value proposition (30 minutes)
4. Update pricing (10 minutes)
5. Proofread (15 minutes)

**Total: 85 minutes per proposal.**

At scale, this breaks. More deals means more proposals means less time for actual selling.

### The Architecture

**Component 1: The Knowledge Base**

Build a repository containing:
- Company background and value propositions
- All case studies with outcomes, industries, and company sizes
- Product/service descriptions
- Pricing tiers and package options
- Standard terms and conditions
- Brand voice guide

**Component 2: The System Prompt (POP Framework)**

- **Persona:** "You are a senior sales engineer who writes compelling, non-salesy proposals. You understand that proposals must address specific pain points, not just describe features."

- **Objective:** "Generate customized proposals that address the prospect's specific challenges identified in their discovery call. Select the most relevant case studies automatically. Lead with outcomes, not capabilities."

- **Parameters:** "Match tone to industry (conservative for finance, innovative for tech startups). Include exactly 3 relevant case studies. Provide clear next steps. Maximum 4 pages. No jargon."

**Component 3: The Quality Gates**

Before sending, verify:
- No hallucinated case studies (cross-reference your knowledge base)
- Pricing accuracy (check against current rate card)
- Pain point alignment (did it address what they actually said?)
- **Human review always required**

### The Workflow

1. Complete discovery call
2. Feed transcript to Proposal Writer GPT
3. AI extracts: pain points, decision criteria, budget signals, timeline
4. AI selects: relevant case studies, appropriate pricing tier
5. AI writes: customized proposal
6. Human reviews and refines (5-10 minutes)

**Total: 10-15 minutes.**

### The Template Multiplier Effect

First proposal with this system: 60 minutes (building the assistant)
Second proposal: 30 minutes
Third proposal: 15 minutes
Tenth proposal: Almost nothing (pure template reuse)

The efficiency compounds. Build once, deploy across your entire pipeline.

### Real-World Validation

One of our students discovered her proposals had a tone mismatch—company voice was aspirational and purpose-driven, but her ICP wanted tactical and operational language. AI proposal analysis caught what manual review missed.

## System 3: The Content Waterfall

### The Problem

Your buyers are on 25+ channels daily. LinkedIn. Instagram. TikTok. ChatGPT. Perplexity. Podcasts. YouTube. Slack. Email.

You can't manually create unique content for all of them.

But if you're not visible across channels, you don't exist in the 80% of the buying cycle that happens before first contact.

### The Waterfall System

**Input: One 30-minute video**
(Could be: keynote talk, solo rant, webinar, client interview, facilitated conversation)

**Processing Layer 1: Atomization**
- Tool: Cuso.ai or similar ($50/month)
- Output: 14 short clips (30-130 seconds) + 11 chapter clips (2-5 minutes)
- Each clip: Auto-captioned, viral-scored, platform recommendations

**Processing Layer 2: Content Multiplication**
- Feed transcripts to Content Waterfall Assistant (custom GPT)
- Command: "Run a content waterfall based on this transcript"

**What the Assistant Generates:**
- 2 blog posts (different sites, different wording to avoid duplicate content penalty)
- 4 LinkedIn posts (different angles from same content)
- 2 LinkedIn carousels (12 slides each)
- Short-form video scripts
- Image prompts for each piece

**The Math:**

1 video × 25 clips × 4 platforms = 100+ video posts
+ 2 blog posts
+ 4 LinkedIn posts
+ 2 carousels

**Total: 53+ pieces from one 30-minute session.**

### Building Your Content Waterfall Assistant

You need two core documents:

**Document 1: Writing Style Guide**
- How you write (sentence length, word choice, structure)
- Tone (casual vs. formal, first-person vs. third-person)
- What you never say (anti-glossary)
- Formatting preferences

**Document 2: Worldview Guide**
- How you think (values, beliefs, principles)
- What you stand for (and against)
- Your perspective on industry issues
- Decision-making framework

**The Prompt Template:**

"You are a Content Waterfall Assistant for [Your Name/Brand]. You repurpose long-form content using voice, strategy, and worldview from the attached documents.

When content is uploaded:
1. Read and understand the core insights
2. Generate 2 blog posts (different angles, different wording)
3. Generate 4 LinkedIn posts (different hooks)
4. Generate carousel text (12 slides)
5. Suggest image prompts for each piece

Maintain consistent voice throughout. Never invent examples or case studies—only use what's in the source material."

### Real-World Validation

Shane Gibson: "This year over six figures of opportunities coming in through AI-based search and chat where people told us we found you through ChatGPT or Perplexity first."

Content multiplication isn't about vanity metrics. It's about being findable in AI search.

## System 4: The Discovery Call Coach

### The Problem

You have great calls. You have terrible calls. You don't always know which is which until the deal is lost.

Traditional coaching: Wait for weekly 1-on-1. Manager reviews (maybe) some calls. Feedback is general. Improvement is slow.

### The AI Coaching System

**Step 1: Record Every Call**

Tools: Fireflies, Fathom, Read AI (all similar, pick one)

These tools:
- Auto-transcribe every call
- Identify speakers
- Create searchable archives
- Generate summaries

**Step 2: Feed to Sales Coach GPT**

System prompt for your Sales Coach:

"You are an expert sales coach with 20 years of experience. Analyze discovery call transcripts and provide actionable feedback.

For each transcript, evaluate:
1. **Questions asked vs. should have asked** (What discovery gaps exist?)
2. **Objection handling** (How were concerns addressed? What was missed?)
3. **Next step clarity** (Did we establish clear next action with timeline?)
4. **Rapport indicators** (What connection moments happened or were missed?)
5. **Talk ratio** (Ideal: prospect talks 70%. What was actual?)

Be direct, specific, and constructive. Give 2-3 concrete improvements for the next call."

**Step 3: Immediate Feedback Loop**

After every call:
1. Upload transcript to Sales Coach GPT
2. Review analysis (5 minutes)
3. Note 1-2 specific improvements
4. Apply to next call

**The Speed Difference:**

Traditional coaching: Weekly iteration (if you're lucky)
AI coaching: Daily iteration (after every call)

### The Pre-Call Cheat Sheet

Before meetings, have AI generate:

"Based on the attached research about [Company], my ICP criteria, and my common discovery questions, generate a pre-call cheat sheet including:
- 5 tailored discovery questions for this specific prospect
- 3 likely objections and suggested handling
- Key stakeholder priorities to uncover
- Signals that indicate A-level qualification"

### Real-World Validation

The Sales Coach GPT doesn't replace human managers—it supplements them. AI gives immediate tactical feedback (questions missed, talk ratio). Humans provide strategic career guidance (territory planning, deal strategy).

Both matter. AI makes you iterate faster.

## System 5: The 7-Touch Follow-Up Sequence

### The Problem

Follow-up is where deals die.

Not because salespeople don't care. Because follow-up is manual, inconsistent, and easy to deprioritize when new leads appear.

### The Automated Sequence

**Shane's 7-Touch Framework:**

| Day | Type | Goal |
|-----|------|------|
| 0 | Post-call thank you + recap | Establish momentum |
| 2 | Relevant article/resource | Pure value, no ask |
| 7 | Proposal delivery (if applicable) | Advance the deal |
| 10 | Check-in question (specific, not "following up") | Re-engage |
| 17 | Case study share (similar company success) | Social proof |
| 24 | "Closing the loop" email | Permission to move on or re-engage |
| 30+ | Monthly nurture | Long-term top-of-mind |

### The AI Automation

**Input:** Discovery call transcript

**Output:** All 7 emails drafted, personalized with:
- Company name and specific pain points mentioned
- Relevant case study selection based on industry/size
- Tailored questions referencing actual conversation
- Tone adaptation per email (helpful → consultative → direct)

**The Prompt:**

"Based on this discovery call transcript with [Company Name], draft a 7-email follow-up sequence using this framework: [paste framework].

For each email:
- Reference specific pain points or interests from the call
- Maintain professional but warm tone
- Include clear next step or call to action
- Day 2 email: Find relevant article topic (I'll add actual link)
- Day 17 email: Suggest which of my case studies would be most relevant

Format each email with Subject Line, Body, and Suggested Send Time."

### The Silence Analyzer

When prospects go dark:

"I sent this proposal 10 days ago to [Company Name]. Here's the discovery call transcript and proposal. Based on what was discussed, why might they not be responding? What are the likely blockers? What should my next move be?"

**AI Analysis Might Show:**
- Budget cycle timing (they mentioned Q4 freeze)
- Multiple stakeholders (CFO not yet involved)
- Competing priorities (merger mentioned in passing)

**Recommendation:** Don't chase with another "just checking in." Send value-add content related to their competing priority.

## Putting It All Together

### The Sales Leader's AI Stack

**Morning routine:**
1. 3-minute Perplexity research on today's calls
2. Pre-call cheat sheets generated
3. Content waterfall publishing scheduled posts

**During calls:**
1. Recording runs (Fireflies/Fathom)
2. Focus on conversation, not note-taking

**Post-call:**
1. Transcript to Sales Coach GPT (immediate feedback)
2. Transcript to Proposal Writer (if advancing)
3. Follow-up sequence drafted

**Weekly:**
1. Review coaching insights across all calls
2. One video recorded for content waterfall
3. 53 pieces scheduled for the month

### The Transformation Arc

**Week 1:** "I use ChatGPT to write emails."

**Week 6:** "I built a complete AI-augmented sales system—research, proposals, content, coaching, follow-up."

That's not just efficiency gain. That's a fundamentally different way of working.

### What Remains Human

AI handles:
- Research compilation
- First-draft generation
- Pattern recognition
- Consistent follow-up

Humans handle:
- Relationship building (trust is still human)
- Strategic decision-making (which deals to pursue)
- Negotiation nuance (reading the room)
- Creative problem-solving (custom solutions)

**AI handles mechanics. Humans handle meaning.**
