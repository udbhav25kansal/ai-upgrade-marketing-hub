## 1. Judy Sandrock — Crossing the Chasm with AI

**Background:**
- Company: Max IQ Space (Space STEM education programs)
- Location: South Africa
- Years in business: 9 years
- Starting challenge: Stuck at "crossing the chasm" from early adopters to early majority

**The Problem:**
Teachers constantly asked "How does it link to the curriculum?" and Judy had no scalable way to answer. Sales conversations stalled at the same objection, deal after deal.

**The Transformation:**

*Week 5:*
> "I really had a lot of fun building different assistants, and I actually built one today that designs experiments for students based on the curriculum. I've uploaded our entire country's school curriculum to the assistant."

*Week 6:*
- Built two production GPTs being tested by actual teachers
- Discovered special economic zones opportunity via Perplexity (nearly impossible to find manually)
- Mapped power players for entire education ecosystem using Shane's framework
- Screenshot → ChatGPT → Strategic prompt workflow mastered

**What She Built:**
1. **Space STEM Proposal Assistant** — Trained through multiple iterations, focused on teachers (the opposition) and students (the users)
2. **Springbot Technology Assistant** — Links experiments to curriculum automatically, now in teacher testing

**The Outcome:**
> "The last few weeks have been really amazing because I've had to sharpen that saw. I've had to get out that ABC and really work on it and analyze where are we selling, how are we selling, where we're going to need to sell."

**Team Impact:**
Now sharing GPT creation methodology across entire Max IQ Space team—software developers, hardware developers, everyone building custom assistants.

**Instructor Feedback:**
> "You're on a mission and you can see it in your presentation. I'm really looking forward to talking to you in a month after you've banged away on it and iterated." — Kris Krug

**Marketing Angle:**
Nine years stuck at the chasm. Six weeks to build the tools that might finally cross it.

## 2. Bruce — The Voice-Activated Systems Builder

**Background:**
- Company: Applied Compression Systems (ACS)
- Growth: $1M to $20M in one year
- Role: Sales manager — grew from managing 1 to managing 4 salespeople
- Starting challenge: Drowning in manual processes at exponential scale

**The Problem:**
When you 20x revenue in a year, every manual process becomes a bottleneck. Quote generation. Scheduling. Task management. All of it was breaking.

**The Transformation:**

*Initial Capstone Idea:*
Engineering estimation assistant for complex industrial customization — different gases, pressures, temperatures, materials.

*The Pivot:*
> "As revenues and customer base shot up exponentially, time management became critical."

*What He Built:*
Voice-activated scheduling system:
- Records meeting notes, ideas, thoughts, rants via iPhone
- Transcripts saved to Google Drive automatically
- Calendar integration in testing phase
- ChatGPT as development partner (debugging, troubleshooting, workarounds)

**The Struggle (Real Talk):**
> "I know I'm close. That's two nights in a row I've been up till 1 in the morning working on it. I'm positive if I had more money I'd probably be going through iPhones because I want to smash that thing so many times."

**Instructor Response:**
> "You're an AI developer now, Bruce. You didn't probably think of yourself that way, but you are. You're building a product that not only will your team find value in, but you should consider fundraising for this." — Peter Bittner

**The Vision Beyond:**
Full quote-to-CRM automation. Web inquiry → auto-creates quote number → builds folder → stores inquiry form. Voice trigger: "Build a quote for Claudia."

**Marketing Angle:**
Zero software development knowledge. Two nights of frustration. One voice-activated system changing how his team works. That's the arc.

## 3. Dev — The Investor Targeting Strategist

**Background:**
- Company: Clip (Interactive entertainment/serialized IP)
- Role: Just joined as investor this week before capstone
- Starting challenge: Fundraising relies on gut instinct with no structured measurement

**The Problem:**
Founders meet with investors based on gut feel. No scoring system. No systematic call analysis. Guesswork dressed up as strategy.

**The Transformation:**

*Build Time:* Created entire system the day of capstone presentation

**Two-Module AI System:**

*Module 1: Investor ICP Finder*
- Scores investors on 100-point scale across 4 weighted pillars
- Sector fit, stage alignment, geo focus, strategic value
- Example: Green Frontier Capital (perfect fit) vs. Lightspeed India (too late stage)

*Module 2: Discovery Evaluator*
- Analyzes real investor call transcripts
- Uses 16-point SaaS discovery call scorecard
- Provides strengths, fixes, one-sentence next step
- Example score: 81% (A-minus rating)

**Integrated Output:**
- 2×2 matrix: Pitch quality vs. Investor fit
- Pre-call cheat sheets for upcoming meetings
- "GFC represents an ideal strategic and thematic investor for this round—a rare match of AI, media innovation and retention subscription economics"

**Instructor Guidance:**
> "Depending on what documents you gave it beyond sales stuff, if you gave it some stuff about the organization too, you'll probably be able to use it as you're coming on board as an investor in all sorts of ways." — Kris Krug

**Marketing Angle:**
Built the day of capstone. Already scoring investors and analyzing discovery calls. That's speed to production.

## 4. Monica — Go-to-Market Strategy in Hours

**Background:**
- Company: Sustainable period care company
- Role: Marketing
- Challenge: Launching reusable period underwear with limited research time

**The Problem:**
New product launch. Competitor landscape unclear. Limited time for research. CEO needs strategy yesterday.

**The Transformation:**

**Knowledge Base Architecture:**
- Marketing one-pager (company "why" and positioning)
- Founder voice samples (her voice = company voice)
- Website content and current products
- Roger Martin transcripts ("where to play" and "how to win" methodology)
- Heavy competitor analysis from Perplexity
- Brand guide and customer personas

**The Output:**
Comprehensive go-to-market strategy document:
1. Executive Summary
2. Strategic Foundation (Roger Martin methodology embedded)
3. Market Landscape
4. Competitive Insights
5. Customer Profile Styles
6. Strategy
7. Marketing and Brand Pillars
8. Campaign Concepts

**CEO/Co-Founder Feedback:**
> "They absolutely loved it. Google Doc filled with comments: 'Love this. I love this document.'"

**Bonus:**
Same knowledge base produced 2026 marketing strategy—also loved by leadership. Build once, deploy multiple times.

**Marketing Angle:**
CEO said "love this" in comments. That's the validation that matters.

## 5. Matt — Eliminating Sales-to-Onboarding Disputes

**Background:**
- Company: Arya Health
- Problem: "He said/she said" disputes during sales-to-onboarding handover

**The Problem:**
Sales promises one thing. Onboarding expects another. Customer confused. Teams fighting. Everyone loses.

**The Transformation:**

**What He Built:**
Custom GPT that captures sales commitments and creates structured handover documentation.

**Status:**
> "Sales-to-onboarding handover GPT is already live and eliminating disputes."

**The Impact:**
- No more miscommunication
- Clean handovers from sales to onboarding
- Customer expectations properly set and documented
- Team friction eliminated

**Marketing Angle:**
Not someday. Not testing. Already live. Already working. Already eliminating disputes. That's production impact in six weeks.

## 6. Patrick — Industrial B2B LinkedIn at Scale

**Background:**
- Company: Applied Compression Systems (works with Bruce)
- Starting challenge: Growing LinkedIn presence for industrial company

**The Transformation:**

**Discovery Interview Methodology:**
> "Asking it questions along the lines of what additional information you need to know, and then I've been able to send those questions out to people like Bruce or our controls team and get the proper information."

**The Output:**
> "Here's a 4-week marketing plan for LinkedIn on strictly controls."

**The System:**
1. Custom GPT asks what it needs to know
2. Patrick interviews internal SMEs (Bruce, controls team)
3. Knowledge base grows with real expertise
4. AI generates marketing plans from that knowledge

**Production Validation:**
LinkedIn marketing manager generating posts with positive feedback from trade show attendees.

**Marketing Angle:**
Discovery interviews with your own team → knowledge base → AI marketing plans. The methodology scales across any B2B company.

## 7. Joel — Employee Benefits Selection App (No Code)

**Background:**
- Company: Flex Benefits
- Challenge: Employee benefits selection is confusing and time-consuming

**The Transformation:**

**What He Built:**
Full web application for employee benefits selection:
- AI recommendations for benefit options
- Voice integration for accessibility
- Interactive benefits selection interface
- Built using Lovable (vibe coding platform)

**The Achievement:**
Production-quality web application built with zero traditional coding. Pure vibe coding approach.

**Marketing Angle:**
Sales professional. Not a developer. Built a full web app. That's what's possible now.

## 8. Josh & David — Cross-Cohort Collaboration

**Background:**
- Company: Spark Joy
- Team: 6-person collaboration across Creative Pros + Sales Leaders cohorts
- Challenge: Manual quote estimation, no lead qualification

**The Transformation:**

**What They Built:**
Self-serve quote estimator + ICP scoring system:
- Public-facing quote estimator tool
- Backend ABC lead scoring
- A/B leads → proposal generator or call scheduling
- WordPress integration (production-ready)

**The Innovation:**
Cross-cohort skill sharing. Creative Pros + Sales Leaders working together. Network effects in action.

**Kris's Framing:**
> "Self-serve something on the front end, but that leads to a lead scoring and ranking thing on the back end, where it's flagging the good ones and telling you what to do about them."

**Marketing Angle:**
Public-facing tool doubles as lead qualification. Elegant design. Cross-team collaboration.

## 9. Cole — Web Scraping Data Detective

**Background:**
- Company: Talius
- Challenge: Manual social media analytics review across multiple platforms

**The Initial Vision:**
> "If I just never have to click on the analytics tabs in either of those websites again, that'd be nice."

**The Transformation:**

**What He Discovered:**
Web scraping through source code inspection. Now extracting 550+ qualified school board leads.

**The System:**
- Social impact dashboard pulling multi-platform data
- Dashboards learning from usage patterns
- Self-improving through interaction

**Kris's Expansion:**
> "Maybe every time you interact with it, it somehow writes it to its own system and learns over time how to give you the dashboards you need."

**Marketing Angle:**
Started wanting to avoid clicking analytics tabs. Ended with 550+ qualified leads and self-improving dashboards.

## 10. Ali — The 1,000-Hour Video Knowledge Base

**Background:**
- Company: Manage Petro (petroleum management software)
- Asset: 1,000+ hours of recorded training/demonstration videos
- Challenge: Knowledge locked in videos, impossible to search

**The Vision:**
> "I want to somehow convert it to a knowledge that, when they're asking the question, it can show them the right video portion. I prefer that it can grab a screenshot of the portion of the video and say, 'Hey, is this a screenshot of what you mean? Do you want me to play the video?'"

**The Intervention:**

Kris's critical coaching moment:
> "Ali, have you thought about going minimal viable product as simple as possible? What I want you to do is make a custom GPT assistant that you personally can use. What's the top 20 themes in these thousand hours? What is the most useful support tips and tools?"

**The Lesson:**
Don't jump straight to engineering the final system. Build personal GPT assistants to analyze, strategize, and prototype first. There's an intermediary step.

**The Shift:**
From "build complex video support system" to "understand the dataset through AI-assisted analysis first."

**Marketing Angle:**
1,000 hours of knowledge. The wrong approach: engineer a complex system. The right approach: build a simple assistant to understand what you have first. That coaching saved months of wasted effort.
