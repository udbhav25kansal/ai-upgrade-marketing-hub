## EMAIL 1: THE 80% PROBLEM

**Send:** Week -1 (Early Bird Launch)
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Your prospects researched you in ChatGPT this morning"
- "The 80% of buying you never see"
- "What AI says about you when you're not there"

---

Hey there,

Kris Krug here. Founder of The Upgrade AI. I've spent the last two years training sales professionals—from enterprise teams to solo founders—on how to actually work with AI.

I'm writing because you signed up to learn about AI Upgrade for Sales Leaders. And I want to start with a number that changes everything:

**80%**

That's how much of the buying cycle happens before you know a prospect exists.

They've Googled you. They've asked ChatGPT about your company. They've compared you to competitors. They've prepared questions to ask you based on AI analysis.

THEN they reach out.

By the time you get that email or that call, they've already made most of their decision.

Here's what that means for you:

If you're not producing AI-discoverable content, you don't exist in that 80% phase.

If ChatGPT doesn't know who you are, you're not even in the consideration set.

One of our instructors, Shane Gibson, is now generating over six figures of opportunities from AI-based search. Prospects tell him: "We found you through ChatGPT."

That's not theoretical. That's revenue. This year.

Over the next few days, I'll share exactly how our program transforms sales professionals from AI users to AI builders—from one-off prompting to complete sales systems.

For now, one question:

**What does ChatGPT say about you when your prospects ask?**

If you don't know, we should probably talk.

— Kris

P.S. If you already know you want in, reply "READY" and I'll send the full details.

## EMAIL 2: THE MULTIPLICATION REALITY

**Send:** Launch Week Day 1
**Subject Line Options:**
- "53 pieces of content from 30 minutes"
- "While your competitors craft one blog post..."
- "The content waterfall math"

---

Let me show you what multiplication looks like.

Your competitors: Writing one LinkedIn post. Taking 30 minutes. Maybe posting twice a week.

Sales leaders who understand content waterfalls: Creating one 30-minute video. Getting 53 pieces of content. Dominating every channel their buyers use.

**The breakdown:**
- 14 short clips (30-130 seconds)
- 11 chapter clips (2-5 minutes)
- 2 blog posts (different sites, different wording)
- 4 LinkedIn posts (different angles)
- 2 carousels (12 slides each)
- Short-form video scripts
- Image prompts for each piece

From one video.

**Why this matters:**

Your buyers are on 25+ channels daily. LinkedIn. Instagram. TikTok. ChatGPT. Perplexity. Podcasts. YouTube. Slack.

You can't manually create content for all of them. But you can create once and atomize everywhere.

Shane Gibson searches "keynote speaker on AI for sales." He owns 80% of the first page. Not through traditional SEO. Through content atomization.

**Here's the thing most people miss:**

AI determines expertise by volume of quality mentions across the entire internet. Not just your website. Your LinkedIn. Your YouTube. Your podcast appearances. All of it.

The salespeople winning now aren't better at cold calling.

They're better at being found.

Tomorrow I'll explain why our approach is different from every other AI course you've seen.

— Kris

P.S. Still doing prospect research manually? That 30-minute Google-and-wing-it routine? We compress that to 3 minutes with better quality. That's just Week 2.

## EMAIL 3: SYSTEMS VS. TOOLS

**Send:** Launch Week Day 3
**Subject Line Options:**
- "The difference between users and builders"
- "Why prompts aren't enough"
- "From ChatGPT helper to sales system architect"

---

Let me draw a line.

**Tool users:** Open ChatGPT. Type a prompt. Get output. Copy-paste. Repeat.

**System builders:** Create proposal writers with proprietary knowledge bases. Build content waterfalls that run on autopilot. Deploy AI coaches that analyze every call.

Most AI courses teach the first path. "Here's how to prompt ChatGPT." "Here's how to use Claude." "Here's the latest feature."

That's fine. It's also free on YouTube.

**We teach the second path.**

Here's what that looks like:

**Proposal Writing (Traditional):** 85 minutes finding templates, searching for case studies, customizing, proofreading.

**Proposal Writing (System Builder):** 10-15 minutes. Feed discovery call transcript to Proposal Writer GPT. AI extracts pain points, selects relevant case studies, drafts proposal. Human reviews and refines.

The difference isn't the AI. It's the architecture underneath—the knowledge base, the system prompt, the quality gates.

**Content (Traditional):** Write one LinkedIn post. 30 minutes of staring at blank page. Post. Repeat tomorrow.

**Content (System Builder):** Record one 30-minute video. Content Waterfall Assistant generates 53 pieces. Schedule for the month. Done.

The difference isn't working more. It's building systems that multiply your effort.

**Here's what we actually teach:**

Week 1: Foundations + Expert Optimism (why more knowledge = less fear)
Week 2: Discovery & Coaching (AI-powered call prep and post-call analysis)
Week 3: Proposals & Follow-Up (automated generation, 7-touch sequences)
Week 4: Content Waterfall (53 pieces from one input)
Week 5: CRM Intelligence & Segmentation
Week 6: Capstone Presentations (you ship a real tool)

By Week 6, you have a complete AI-augmented sales system. Not just knowledge. A working toolkit.

Next email: The full curriculum breakdown and what alumni have actually built.

— Kris

P.S. One of our students, Bruce, grew his company from $1M to $20M in a year. When he joined our course, he was building a voice-activated scheduling system to handle the chaos of exponential growth. Zero coding background. Just persistence and AI assistance.

---

I could keep explaining what we teach.

Let me show you what people BUILD.

---

**BRUCE (Applied Compression Systems)**

Company grew $1M → $20M in one year.
Challenge: Drowning in manual processes.

He built: Voice-activated scheduling and task system.
Status: 95% complete, in daily testing.

Peter's feedback: "You're an AI developer now, Bruce. You didn't probably think of yourself that way, but you are."

Zero coding background. Two late nights of debugging. A system that's changing how his team works.

---

**DEV (Clip)**

Just joined as investor, week of capstone.
Challenge: Fundraising based on gut instinct.

He built: Two-module AI system.
- Investor ICP Finder (100-point scoring across 4 pillars)
- Discovery Evaluator (16-point scorecard for call analysis)

Built the entire system the day of capstone. Already scoring investors and analyzing discovery calls.

---

**MONICA (Sustainable Period Care)**

Challenge: Launching new product with limited research time.

She built: Complete go-to-market strategy using custom GPT.

CEO/Co-Founder feedback: "Love this. I love this document."

Google Doc filled with enthusiastic comments. Same system produced 2026 marketing strategy—also loved.

---

**MATT (Arya Health)**

Challenge: "He said/she said" disputes during sales-to-onboarding handover.

He built: Sales-to-onboarding handover GPT.
Status: **Already live. Already eliminating disputes.**

Not someday. Today.

---

**JUDY (Max IQ Space)**

Challenge: 9 years stuck at "crossing the chasm" in space education sales.

She built:
- Space STEM Proposal Assistant (trained through multiple iterations)
- Springbot Technology Assistant (links experiments to curriculum automatically)

Both GPTs now being tested by actual teachers.

She's planning to retake the course: "I picked up maybe 15%, 20%... it was a firehose which I loved."

---

**JOSH & DAVID (Spark Joy)**

6-person team across two cohorts (Creative Pros + Sales Leaders).

They built: Self-serve quote estimator + ICP scoring system.
- Public-facing tool doubles as lead qualification
- A/B leads automatically routed to proposal generator
- WordPress integration, production-ready

Cross-cohort collaboration proving network effects.

---

These aren't demos. These are production systems solving real business problems.

What would YOUR capstone be?

## EMAIL 6: LAST CALL

**Send:** Week 3 (Close)
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Final call: doors close [DATE]"
- "This is the last email"
- "Systems builder or status quo?"

---

This is my last email about this cohort.

Enrollment closes in [X hours].

Let me be straight about what's at stake.

**Six weeks from now, you'll be somewhere.**

**Option A:** Building AI-augmented sales systems. 3-minute prospect research instead of 30. Proposals in 15 minutes instead of 85. Content waterfall shipping 53 pieces a month. Showing up in ChatGPT searches before your competitors.

**Option B:** Exactly where you are now. Same manual research. Same proposal grind. Same sporadic LinkedIn posting. Watching the 80% invisible buying cycle happen without you.

The gap between those futures is one decision.

---

**I know the objections:**

"I don't have time for a 6-week course."
90 minutes a week. And the course SAVES time. Research drops from 30 minutes to 3. Proposals from 85 to 15. The ROI is immediate.

"It's expensive."
Priced less than one day of lost productivity. Monica's go-to-market strategy was loved by her CEO. Matt's handover GPT is eliminating team disputes. The value compounds.

"I'll figure it out on my own."
Maybe. Or maybe you'll still be doing one-off prompting a year from now. The course provides architecture, coaching, and accountability. That's why people ship.

"I'm not technical enough."
Bruce has zero coding background. Joel built a full web app for benefits selection with no traditional coding. We don't teach programming. We teach systems.

---

**Here's what I know:**

The sales leaders winning right now aren't hiding from AI.
They aren't competing with AI.
They're building with AI.

I've created a place where you can learn to do that. With methodology. With community. With real capstones that solve real problems.

The door closes on [DATE] at [TIME].

**[SECURE YOUR SPOT]**

---

If this isn't right for you, I respect that. Unsubscribe and no hard feelings.

But if you've been waiting for a sign, consider this it.

Your prospects are researching you in ChatGPT right now.
The question is what they're finding.

— Kris

P.S. Still have a question? Reply right now. I'll answer before enrollment closes. That's a promise.
