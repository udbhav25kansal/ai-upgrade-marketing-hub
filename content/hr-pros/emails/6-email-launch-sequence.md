## EMAIL 1: THE BIG HELLO

**Subject:** Your HR Pro's Guide to AI [Downloaded - Here's What's Next]

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- You downloaded the playbook. Now what?
- The real work starts here
- From reading about AI to building with AI

---

Hey [FIRSTNAME],

You just downloaded The HR Pro's Guide to AI.

Here's what that tells me about you:

You're not ignoring AI. You're not waiting for someone else to figure it out. You're the HR leader who's going to transform your organization WITH this technology.

That playbook gives you the frameworks. The POP method. The agentic spectrum. The ethics guardrails.

But here's what I know from teaching seven cohorts of HR professionals:

**Reading about AI doesn't transform your HR practice. Building transforms your HR practice.**

The HR leaders who've achieved the biggest transformations—the ones who cut time-to-hire by 40%, who automated onboarding to save 5 hours per new employee, who now lead their company's AI strategy—they all did three things:

1. They built real tools (not just learned concepts)
2. They got coaching (personalized guidance on their specific HR challenges)
3. They joined a community (peer support from other HR leaders navigating the same transformation)

Over the next two weeks, I'm going to show you exactly what that looks like.

Tomorrow, I'll share the biggest challenge every HR professional faces with AI—and why it's actually your competitive advantage.

— Kris

P.S. — Quick question: What's the one HR process that drains your time the most? Hit reply and tell me. I read every response, and I'll share how other HR pros have tackled the same problem with AI.

## EMAIL 2: THE PROBLEM - HR'S AI ANXIETY

**Subject:** The question every HR leader is asking (and why it's the wrong question)

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- Will AI replace HR? Wrong question.
- Your AI anxiety is normal. Here's why.
- The fear is real. The opportunity is bigger.

---

[FIRSTNAME],

Every HR professional I talk to asks the same question:

**"Is AI going to replace me or help me?"**

Wrong question.

The right question is: "How do I become the HR leader who transforms my organization WITH AI?"

Here's where the anxiety comes from:

**Fear #1: "AI will eliminate HR jobs"**

You've seen the headlines. You've heard the predictions. You're wondering if you're automating yourself out of existence.

Here's what the data actually shows: AI doesn't replace HR professionals. It replaces HR professionals who refuse to use it.

The skills that make you valuable—reading a room, sensing when someone's struggling, building trust through tough conversations, navigating the messy complexity of human relationships—AI can't do that.

What AI CAN do: Take the administrative work that keeps you from doing the actual human work.

**Fear #2: "AI has bias problems—how can I use it ethically?"**

This is the smartest question to ask.

And here's the counterintuitive truth: AI can actually REDUCE bias when used right.

Human hiring has massive bias problems. Resume screening favors familiar names and schools. Interviews favor people who look and sound like interviewers. Promotion decisions favor whoever's loudest in the room.

AI doesn't eliminate bias. But it makes bias **visible and auditable** in ways human decisions never are.

You can't fix what you can't measure. AI makes bias measurable.

**Fear #3: "I don't know where to start"**

This is the real blocker. You see the potential. You understand the urgency. But you don't know which AI tool to use, what vendor to trust, or how to implement this without creating compliance nightmares.

Here's what I've learned teaching HR professionals across seven cohorts:

The ones who succeed start with something small and reversible. Not their entire performance review system. Not their HRIS overhaul.

They start with job descriptions. Or interview scheduling. Or onboarding document generation.

They build confidence with quick wins. They scale with strategy.

Tomorrow, I'll show you the human-centric approach that makes AI safe, ethical, and effective for HR work.

— Kris

P.S. — 75% of AI experts are optimistic about the technology. Not naive optimism from people who don't understand the risks. Informed perspective from people who understand BOTH the dangers AND the opportunities. That's where we're headed.

## EMAIL 3: THE HUMAN-CENTRIC APPROACH

**Subject:** How to use AI in HR without losing the "human" in Human Resources

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- The frameworks that make AI safe for HR
- Algorithmic humility + your original intelligence
- Your judgment is your moat. AI amplifies it.

---

[FIRSTNAME],

Here's the framework that changes everything for HR professionals using AI:

**Your judgment is your competitive moat. AI amplifies judgment. It doesn't replace it.**

AI can analyze a thousand resumes in seconds. It can draft job descriptions. It can even predict flight risk based on engagement data.

But AI can't do what you do:
- Navigate organizational politics with emotional intelligence
- Know when to break the rules for the right person
- Build culture through a thousand tiny decisions
- See the human behind the data

This is why we teach the **Fulcrum methodology** in AI Upgrade for HR Professionals.

**The Fulcrum Methodology for HR:**

Think of AI as a lever. You're the fulcrum—the point of balance and control.

Without the fulcrum, the lever does nothing. Without your judgment, AI outputs are just faux work product—looks finished but isn't actually what needs to be done.

Here's how it works in practice:

**Human-in-the-Loop Decision Making:**

1. AI screens and ranks candidates
2. Human reviews recommendations
3. Human makes final decision
4. Decision rationale is documented
5. Patterns are audited for bias

AI supports decisions. It never makes them.

**Algorithmic Humility:**

This is my favorite term for how we approach AI in HR work.

Algorithmic humility = admitting AI doesn't have all the answers.

When implementing AI in HR:
- Be transparent about what AI does and doesn't do
- Acknowledge limitations
- Invite feedback from employees
- Audit for bias and share results
- Maintain human accountability

Your employees will trust AI in HR when they see YOU don't blindly trust it.

**The POP Framework:**

Every AI interaction. Every prompt. Every custom assistant you build for HR work—use this framework:

- **P - Persona:** Who should AI act as? (An experienced talent acquisition specialist? An empathetic HR business partner?)
- **O - Objective:** What specific HR task should it accomplish?
- **P - Parameters:** How should it deliver? (Tone, length, format, compliance constraints)

Same AI. Same prompt box. Completely different results.

Here's what this looks like in real HR scenarios:

**Bad Prompt:**
"Write me a job description for an HR manager"

**Good Prompt:**
"You are an experienced talent acquisition specialist with expertise in building diverse teams. Create a job description for a Senior HR Business Partner in a 200-person tech company. Use inclusive, outcome-focused language. Focus on skills rather than years of experience. Keep it under 500 words. Ensure EEOC compliance."

This is what we practice every week in the cohort. Real prompts. Real HR scenarios. Real outputs you can use Monday morning.

Tomorrow, I'll walk you through what our 6-week curriculum looks like—and who's teaching it.

— Kris

P.S. — The HR professionals who succeed with AI share one trait: They treat AI as their second brain, not their replacement. You bring original intelligence. AI brings speed and scale. Together, you transform HR.

## EMAIL 4: YOUR AI JOURNEY - THE 6-WEEK CURRICULUM

**Subject:** What happens when HR pros spend 6 weeks building with AI

## EMAIL 5: WHAT THEY COULD BUILD

**Subject:** What HR pros build in 6 weeks (real tools, real outcomes)

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- From zero AI experience to leading the transformation
- Portfolio pieces that earned promotions
- The tools alumni are actually using

---

[FIRSTNAME],

Let me show you what's possible.

These are real tools built by HR professionals in AI Upgrade—people who started exactly where you are:

**SARAH - HR DIRECTOR, 500-PERSON SAAS COMPANY**

Started the program: "I was terrified AI would replace HR. I had zero AI experience."

What she built: A compliance policy review assistant that analyzes employee handbook updates for clarity, legal gaps, and bias. It cut her policy review time from 2 hours to 20 minutes.

Where she is now: Leading her company's HR AI strategy. She pitched the executive team, got budget approval, and is now rolling out AI tools across the people operations function.

Her words: "I went from fearing AI would replace me to leading our company's HR AI strategy. The frameworks are portable across any platform, and the coaching helped me navigate our specific compliance concerns."

**MARCUS - TALENT ACQUISITION MANAGER, TECH STARTUP**

Started the program: "We were drowning in applications. I needed to scale recruiting without sacrificing quality."

What he built: A candidate screening assistant that evaluates resumes against role-specific criteria, generates structured interview questions, and creates scoring rubrics. It maintains consistency across interviewers while reducing bias.

Impact: Cut time-to-hire by 40%. Improved interviewer consistency scores by 60%.

His words: "The capstone project became my portfolio piece. I built a candidate screening assistant that cut our time-to-hire by 40% while improving consistency across interviewers."

**JENNIFER - HR BUSINESS PARTNER, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FIRM**

Started the program: "I was spending 10 hours a week on onboarding paperwork and reminders."

What she built: An onboarding automation workflow that sends personalized checklists, schedules stakeholder meetings, triggers IT setup requests, and follows up on incomplete tasks.

Impact: Saved 5 hours per new hire. Improved new hire satisfaction scores by 30%.

Her words: "This wasn't theory. We built real tools every week. By week 3, I had an onboarding automation running that saved me 5 hours per new hire."

**DAVID - L&D PROFESSIONAL, MANUFACTURING COMPANY**

Started the program: "I wanted to personalize training but didn't have time to customize for 200+ employees."

What he built: A learning pathway generator that analyzes role requirements, skill gaps, and career goals to create personalized 90-day learning plans.

Impact: Increased training completion rates by 45%. Employees report feeling "seen" in their development.

His words: "I used to spend hours customizing learning plans. Now my AI assistant drafts them in 5 minutes, and I spend my time coaching people through the actual learning."

**WHAT YOU COULD BUILD:**

Think about the HR process that drains your time the most:
- Is it screening hundreds of applications?
- Is it drafting job descriptions for every new role?
- Is it analyzing engagement survey results?
- Is it creating onboarding materials?
- Is it reviewing policies for compliance?
- Is it helping managers write better performance feedback?

Whatever it is—you can build an AI tool for it in this program.

Not a vendor solution that costs $50K and doesn't fit your workflow.

A custom tool built by you, for your specific HR challenges, using the frameworks that work across any AI platform.

Tomorrow, I'm sending you the final email in this series. It's decision time.

— Kris

P.S. — The pattern across every cohort is the same: Week 1, anxiety and questions. Week 3, first working prototype deployed. Week 6, "Why didn't I learn this sooner?" This is the transformation timeline.

## EMAIL 6: LAST CALL - URGENCY & OBJECTION HANDLING

**Subject:** Last chance to join the next HR AI cohort

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- This is it. What's your call?
- The cohort launches soon. Are you in?
- A year from now, you'll wish you started today

---

[FIRSTNAME],

This is the last email in the sequence.

Over the past two weeks, I've shown you:

- Why AI anxiety is normal (and how to move past it)
- The human-centric frameworks that make AI safe for HR
- What the 6-week curriculum looks like
- What HR professionals have actually built in the program

Now it's decision time.

**NEXT COHORT LAUNCHES 2026.**

If you're ready to move from reading about AI to building with AI, here's what happens next:

Reply to this email or visit theupgrade.ai to book a call.

We'll talk about:
- Your specific HR challenges
- What you want to build
- Whether this program is right for you

Not a sales call. A real conversation about whether this is the right fit.

**I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING:**

**"I don't have time for a 6-week program."**

You're spending 10+ hours a week on work that could be automated. This program gives you that time back—permanently.

The question isn't whether you have time. It's whether you can afford NOT to invest this time.

**"I'm not technical. Can I really build AI tools?"**

Every HR professional who's gone through this program started with zero AI experience. Some barely knew what a prompt was.

By week 3, they're building working prototypes.

The curriculum is designed for HR professionals, not engineers. If you can use a web browser, you can do this.

**"My organization isn't ready for AI yet."**

Your organization is using AI whether they've decided to or not. Employees are using ChatGPT for work. Vendors are pitching AI tools. Executives are asking questions.

The question isn't whether your organization will use AI. It's whether YOU'LL be the one leading the strategy or reacting to someone else's decisions.

**"What if I build something and it doesn't work?"**

That's what the coaching is for. That's what the community is for.

You get two 1-on-1 calls with instructors who've built HR AI tools for real organizations. You get peer support from other HR professionals navigating the same challenges.

You're not doing this alone.

**THE TRUTH:**

A year from now, you'll be in one of two places:

1. Still overwhelmed by the same HR processes, watching other HR leaders implement AI while you figure it out

2. Leading your organization's HR AI transformation with real tools, measurable outcomes, and the confidence that comes from actually building

The difference between those two futures is what you decide right now.

**READY TO START?**

Reply to this email or visit theupgrade.ai to book a call.

Let's talk about what you want to build.

— Kris

P.S. — The HR professionals who succeed in this program share one trait: They're done waiting for someone else to figure it out. They're ready to lead. If that's you, let's talk.

## BONUS EMAIL 7 (OPTIONAL): POST-DEADLINE RE-ENGAGEMENT

**Subject:** I'm keeping one spot open

**Send:** 3 days after enrollment deadline

---

[FIRSTNAME],

Enrollment closed three days ago.

I'm keeping one spot open.

Here's why:

Every cohort, there's someone who almost enrolled but didn't. Something stopped them—timing, budget, confidence, competing priorities.

Six months later, they reach out: "I should have joined. I'm ready now."

By then, they've spent six months doing the same HR work the same way while watching AI transform their industry.

I don't want that to be you.

**IF YOU'RE READING THIS:**

You downloaded the playbook. You read every email. You're clearly thinking about this transformation.

What's stopping you?

Hit reply and tell me. Budget concerns? Timing issues? Not sure if it's right for you?

Let's figure it out. Maybe this cohort isn't the right fit. Maybe it is, and you just need one question answered.

Either way, I'd rather have the conversation than leave you wondering "what if?"

One spot. Open for 48 hours.

— Kris

P.S. — The worst decision is no decision. You either invest in the transformation or you don't. Both are valid choices. But indecision just keeps you stuck in the same place. Let's figure out which path is right for you.
