## EMAIL 1: THE BIG HELLO

**Send:** Week -1 (Early Bird Launch)
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Welcome to the AI Upgrade, friend"
- "Let's talk about the elephant in the creative room"
- "You're curious about AI. Good. Let's go deeper."

---

Hey there,

Kris Krug here. Founder of The Upgrade AI. Photographer. Technologist. Professional question-asker.

I'm writing because you signed up to learn more about AI Upgrade for Creative Professionals. And I wanted to be the one to say hello.

Here's the deal:

You're probably wondering if AI is going to replace you. Or at least dramatically change what you do for a living. And honestly? **Both are true and neither is true.**

The creative professionals who thrive over the next decade won't be the ones fighting AI. They won't be the ones ignoring it. They'll be the ones **building with it.**

That's what we teach. Not how to use ChatGPT (you can figure that out on YouTube). We teach you how to think in frameworks, build custom tools, and turn AI from a threat into a creative superpower.

Our next cohort kicks off soon. Over the next few days, I'm going to share:
- What we actually teach (spoiler: it's not tool tutorials)
- Why our approach is different
- Stories from alumni who've transformed their work
- How to know if this is right for you

For now, I'll leave you with one question:

**What would you build if you knew you couldn't fail at the technical parts?**

Sit with that. I'll be back in a couple days.

— Kris

P.S. If you're already sold and just want the details, reply "READY" and I'll send you the full curriculum and application link.

## EMAIL 2: THE PROBLEM

**Send:** Launch Week Day 1
**Subject Line Options:**
- "The fear no one talks about"
- "It's not AI you're afraid of"
- "The real threat to creative careers (it's not what you think)"

---

Real talk.

I've taught seven cohorts of creative professionals at this point. Designers. Writers. Photographers. Video producers. Journalists. Knowledge managers.

And here's what I've learned:

**The fear isn't AI. The fear is obsolescence.**

It's the feeling that skills you spent years developing might suddenly matter less. It's watching 22-year-olds produce work in minutes that used to take you days. It's not knowing if you should embrace this stuff or resist it.

That fear is real. I'm not going to tell you it's irrational.

But here's what I WILL tell you:

The creative professionals who are struggling right now aren't struggling because AI is too powerful.

They're struggling because they've decided they already know what AI can't do.

**Closed minds get left behind. Open minds get upgraded.**

The data backs this up. 75% of AI experts are optimistic about the technology. The more you know, the less you fear. That's not spin—that's the expert optimism effect.

I've watched hundreds of people go through our program. The transformation is always the same:

Week 1: "Can AI really help me? Or is this just hype?"
Week 6: "Why didn't I learn this sooner?"

The gap between those moments isn't about AI getting better.
It's about YOU getting better at using it.

Tomorrow I'll share what actually makes our approach different. (Hint: it's not the tools we teach.)

— Kris

P.S. Still skeptical? Good. The skeptics often become our best students. They ask hard questions. They don't accept hype. And when they see it work? Their transformation is the most profound.

## EMAIL 3: HUMAN-CENTRIC APPROACH

**Send:** Launch Week Day 3
**Subject Line Options:**
- "AI won't replace you. But..."
- "The human part we refuse to automate"
- "Why most AI courses get it backwards"

---

Let me cut through the noise.

Most AI courses teach tools. "Here's how to use ChatGPT. Here's how to prompt Midjourney. Here's the latest features in Claude."

That's fine. But it's also free on YouTube.

Here's what we do differently:

**We teach frameworks, not tools.**

POP Framework. Agentic Spectrum. Knowledge Base Architecture. These work in ChatGPT. They work in Claude. They work in Gemini. They'll work in whatever comes next.

When the tools change (and they will), you won't have to start over. Because you learned to think, not just to click.

**We build real things.**

Not sandbox exercises. Not hypothetical projects. By Week 4, you have a working AI assistant for YOUR specific workflow. By Week 6, you present a capstone project that becomes a portfolio piece.

One of our alumni built 3 production tools now live globally at Paramount+. Another launched a business with paying clients before the course ended. A 17-year-old founded an entire AI community from the confidence he built.

**We stay human.**

Here's the part most AI courses miss:

Your worldview is your moat. AI can learn your writing voice in minutes. But it can't learn the 20 years of experience condensed into your intuition. The hard-won lessons from failures no one else had. The values that drive decisions AI can't replicate.

Voice is mimicable. Worldview is not.

We teach you to build AI tools that amplify YOUR thinking. Not generic tools that could be anyone's.

That's human-centric AI education.

Next email: I'll break down exactly what you learn in 6 weeks and what you walk away with.

— Kris

P.S. Still not sure if this is for you? Reply with your biggest question. I read every email. I might even answer it in the next one.

## EMAIL 5: SOCIAL PROOF DEEP DIVE

**Send:** Week 2
**Subject Line Options:**
- "What they built (and you can too)"
- "From skeptic to cyborg: real stories"
- "The transformations that made ME emotional"

---

I could keep telling you what we teach.

But let me show you what people DO with it.

---

**ROB ROSENBERG (Paramount+)**

Rob took our course and built 3 AI tools as capstone projects.

Those tools are now live globally at Paramount+.

Let that sink in. Course project → Enterprise production infrastructure.

---

**ARMIN LAYEGH (TalentNow)**

Armin joined uncertain about his career direction. He was job hunting.

He built TalentNow as his capstone—an AI-powered talent matching system.

He had 3 paying clients before the course ended.

He pivoted from job seeker to business owner in 6 weeks.

---

**JULIE (Cooking School Owner)**

Julie was skeptical. A journalist with 20+ years experience.

By Week 3, she described AI as "spending the day with my cyborg" after using it to identify plants in her garden all day.

By Week 5, she built her cooking school website in 20 minutes.

"If you knew how long it took us to get to this point in our actual website... I mean it just feels ridiculous."

---

**JEANETTE (Indigenomics Institute)**

Jeanette came in managing transcriptions manually.

By Week 3, she'd built a complete Notion dashboard with databases, PowerPoint outlines, timeline tools, and scraped the entire Indigenomics website into a personal knowledge base.

By Week 6, she deployed a production-ready research assistant for her work as managing director.

---

**MATTHEW SCHWARTZMAN (Surrey AI Community)**

Matthew was 17 when he took Cohort 1.

Today he runs the Surrey AI community. 8+ meetups hosted. 30+ regular attendees.

Age: Irrelevant.
Experience: Minimal.
Impact: Substantial.

---

**DIMITRI (Real Estate Intelligence)**

Dimitri turned dense PDF market reports into an interactive dashboard.

Location filtering. Property type selection. AI-generated market insights.

"Incredible that he's able to slice and dice that data with those sliders right there."

---

These aren't unicorns. They're creative professionals who committed to 6 weeks and built something real.

What would YOUR transformation story be?

## EMAIL 6: LAST CALL

**Send:** Week 3 (Close)
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Final call: doors close [DATE]"
- "This is the last email"
- "The gap between who you are and who you could be"

---

This is my last email about this cohort.

Not because I'm giving up on you. Because enrollment closes in [X hours] and I want to be straight with you.

**Six weeks from now, you'll be somewhere.**

Option A: You'll be building custom AI assistants for your workflow. Vibe coding prototypes in hours instead of weeks. Using frameworks that work across any platform. Part of a community of creative professionals who get it.

Option B: You'll be exactly where you are now. Same anxiety. Same uncertainty. Same FOMO watching everyone else adapt.

The gap between those futures is one decision.

**I know the objections:**

"I don't have time."
You don't have 90 minutes a week? The course SAVES time. Students report 5+ hours saved per week after applying what they learn.

"It's too expensive."
It's priced less than one day of a freelancer's time. And the ROI? Alumni report $25,000+ in annual time value. Some have launched businesses.

"I'll learn it on my own."
Maybe. Or maybe you'll keep saying that for another year. The course provides structure, coaching, accountability, and community. That's why it works.

"I'm not technical enough."
Neither were 90% of our students. We don't teach coding. We teach frameworks anyone can use.

---

**Here's what I know:**

The creative professionals winning right now aren't hiding from AI.
They're not competing with AI.
They're building with AI.

I've created a place where you can learn to do that. With real guidance. With real community. With real outcomes.

The door closes on [DATE] at [TIME].

**[SECURE YOUR SPOT]**

---

If this isn't right for you, I respect that. Unsubscribe and no hard feelings.

But if you've been waiting for a sign, consider this it.

The upgrade awaits.

— Kris

P.S. Still have a question? Reply right now. I'll answer before enrollment closes. That's a promise.
